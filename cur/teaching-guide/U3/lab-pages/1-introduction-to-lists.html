    	<h2>Programming Lab 1: Introduction to Lists</h2>
        <p>Computers manipulate data and return processed information to the user. Numbers, strings of characters (letters, numbers, symbols, etc.), and Boolean values (true, false) are some of the basic pieces of information. Often, these small pieces are arranged in more complex structures: <em>lists</em>, ordered sets of data.</p> 
		<p>A <code>list</code> is not just a collection (set) but also a collection <em>in a particular order</em> (this order is tracked by an <em>index number</em> for each item on the list). If it has any elements at all, it has a first element, a last element, and so on. A list can also be totally empty, with no elements; often that is the way we want to set up (<em>initialize</em>) a list before we add elements to it. The <code>length of</code> an empty list is 0.</p>
            <p>
				Lists are powerful. Databases are lists of lists of lists. Many operations can be performed on data in a list:
				<ul>
					<li>Searching a list to see if it <code>contains</code> some element.</li>
					<li>Modifying lists to <code>add</code>, <code>delete</code>, or <code>replace</code> items, or to <code>insert</code> an item in a specific spot.</li>
                    <li>Creating new lists that <code>keep</code> only certain items from a list you started with.</li>
                    <li>You can create new lists with more or fewer elements than the list you have.</li>
                    <li>You can pick an <code>item</code> of a list by position or characteristic or just randomly. </li>
                    <li>You can do something with each item of the list: you can process it in some way, or <code>for each</code> element of the list, you can display it in some way.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Students begin page 1, Introducion to Lists, by building a basic shopping list app that introduces the ideas that lists can store data and that programs can access and manipulate list contents. In its simplest form, the app allows the user to add items or clear the list. Students can add more features as they learn more about list processing. (In Lab 2, the same basic idea of maintaining a list is used in a contacts list app, in principle like the ones on phones. That app will be revisited and improved several times in the curriculum.)</p>
        <p>On page 2, Exploring List Processing, students explore various list blocks by predicting and testing the outcome of various expressions and small scripts. Students get a preview of several important procedures that will be addressed later in more detail (<code>for each</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code>).</p>
        <p>Page 3, Modeling Sentence Structures, is a project that focuses on using <strong>abstraction</strong> to build structures such as noun phrases out of random selections from lists of words of various categories. Sentence phrase blocks are combined to build simple and complex sentences.</p>

        <h3>Pacing:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>The first page of this lab (Shopping List App) should be relatively quick. Student may finish it and work on the Take it Further questions <em>within one period</em>.</li>
                <li>The two remaining pages (Exploring List Processing and Modeling Sentence Structures) may take <em>one to two class periods</em>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
				<li>Page 1, Shopping List App, is a new page that was not part of this curriculum until October 2015. Teachers should review and, if time, also work though this page before their students. Feedback (via the blue button the lower right) is always appreciated. For a timely response, please use the BJC Piazza site.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


    	<h3>Students will:</h3>
        <div class="sidenoteBig">
        	<div><strong>Looking ahead</strong></div>
        	<ul>
            	<li>Students are briefly introduced to <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code> in Exploring List Processing. They will work with these blocks more in Lab 3: Three Key List Operations.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<ul>
                <li>Continue to practice pair programming.</li>
                <li>Make lists and become familiar with many of the list blocks in the Variables palette.</li>
                <li>Notice the difference between returning a string (or a number) and returning a list&mdash;especially when that list contains only one item that is a string or a number.</li>
                <li>Write scripts for user interface buttons that control items in a shopping list.</li>
                <li>Randomly choose items from lists of words to make a Sentence Builder.</li>

		<h3>As a Class:</h3>
		<div>
        	<ul>
                <li>
                	<strong>Page 1: Shopping List App.</strong>
					<ul>
                    	<div class="comment">When time, add a Google doc. --MF</div>
                        <li>Opener: After the first day with "Shopping List App," present a short script with an error showing (where the error has been caused by neglecting to initialize a list). Ask students: What might have caused the error? What is the proper way to address this issue? (This opener connects to "Shopping List App," where students first initialize a list.)</li>
                        <li>
	                      Discussion: You may wish to review different types of data in Snap<em>!</em>: strings, lists, Booleans, numbers, functions, etc. You might ask:
                            <ul>
                                <li>What is is the difference between a string and a list? (Students without prior programming experience may reply, &quot;what's <em>the same</em> between a string and a list?&quot; The answer is that they're both aggregates. A string is an aggregate whose items are restricted to single characters; a list is an aggregate whose items can be anything.)</li>
                                <li>What else is special about a list? (Use if students don't mention that each item in a list has an index number.)</li>
                                <li>What can you do with a list? Listen for both specific tasks (e.g. "add an item" or "order the items") and also for project ideas (e.g. "track earnings and expenses" or "organize sports data").</li>
                                <li>What kind of data types can be list items? Invite students to experiment with Snap<em>!</em> to answer this question and to consider contexts for which including various data types in a list would be useful. (You should keep in mind that the right answer to questions like this is &quot;<em>any</em> data type can be used <em>anywhere,</em>&quot; if the question means where a user is permitted to put some value. But this shouldn't be a mantra for kids to memorize.)</li>
                                <li>Can you put a list in a list? What are some examples of a list within a list? (Students may not have examples just yet.) This is both a preview of the next lab, "Nesting Lists," and also an introduction to the idea that nesting computational objects is common in programming. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Page 2: Exploring List Processing.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This page asks students to build the blocks (rather than providing a link that has the blocks built already). This is intentional, so that students get the experience of finding these blocks in the palette and getting the logic of what kinds of blocks go inside of other blocks.</li>
                        <li>Students explore blocks such as <code>all but the first of {}</code>, <code>() in front of {}</code>, and <code>item () of {}</code>. Consider asking students to write out a sentence describing the behavior of each of these blocks or to describe them to the class</li>
                        <li>Listen for students making the distinction between expressions that report strings (such as "Boise") and those that report a list containing one item (such as <code>{Boise}</code>). If you don't hear students making this distinction, consider a brief class discussion about it. Knowing what data type is reported is a big help when debugging.</li>
	                    <li>
                        	Discussion: After students have all had a chance to consider the problems on this page, you might ask:
                            <ul>
                                <li>What is the difference between <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/gs2item.png" class="script" alt="item 2 of list block" title="item 2 of list block"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/gs2list.png" class="script" alt="list with item 2 block" title="list with item 2 block">? This question is on the student lab page. Asking it again gives students a chance to refine their understanding that an item (e.g., Boise) is not the same as a <em>list</em> containing just that item.</li>
                                <li>What does the ... block do? (for each of these list reporters: <code>length</code>, <code>all but first</code>, <code>in front of</code>, <code>item</code>, <code>contains</code>)</li>
                                <li>What does the ... block do? (for the following higher-order list blocks: <code>for each</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code>) Students don't need to achieve mastery here. This is just a chance to spend a moment building some initial ideas about these functions before Lab 3: Three Key List Operations.</li>
                              <li>What do you think the ... block does? (for <code>add</code>, <code>delete</code>, <code>insert</code>, and <code>replace</code>) Unit 3 doesn't doesn't focus on these blocks as much as those above because we favor functional programming style. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Page 3: Modeling Sentence Structures.</strong> 
                	<ul>
                    	<li>The page is designed to offer a fun mini-project in which the use of lists feels natural and empowering. Encourage students to be creative and build other kinds of sentences or even simple conversations.</li>
                        <li>This lesson relies on proficiency in the ideas of this class more than knowledge of English sentence structure, but if you have students who are more proficient with another language, you may encourage them to build simple and complex sentence builders in a language of their choice. Students could work with others or alone and then share. Be creative. For example, it might be beneficial to pair a student studying Spanish with a fluent Spanish speaker. Bear in mind, though, that English is by far the easiest language for this project because it has hardly any inflections (case, tense, mood, etc.).</li>
                        <li>As always, if students do interesting work (e.g. with another language or with the Take It Further excercises), consider inviting them to share with the class.</li>
		                <li>Discussion, you might ask: How do the sentence builder blocks demonstrate abstraction?</li>

		<div>
        	<ul>
                <li>
                	<strong>Across Unit 3.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><div class="sidenote">Many of the <span class="snap">snap</span> projects linked from the student pages already have the tools imported.</div>Throughout this Unit, students will have to <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" /> in order to access the blocks they need. This is required every time a student opens a new <span class="snap">snap</span> window. (Links to projects in the curriculum have been shared with the tools already imported.)</li>
                        <li>The words &quot;item&quot; and &quot;element&quot; have the same meaning. We favor &quot;item&quot; because that's the name of the block that examines an item in a list. Try to develop the &quot;item&quot; habit, but it's not a big deal.</li>
                        <li>In Snap<em>!</em>, the first item of a list is item number 1, not number 0 as in some other languages. We think this is clearly advantageous for learners: &quot;the third item&quot; and &quot;item 3&quot; should refer to the same thing. Zero-origin list indexing is a leftover from low-level languages that do arithmetic on array indices. Don't make a fuss about this, either, but if a kid thinks zero-origin is &quot;right&quot; you can point out that ordinals (first, second, third) and cardinals (1, 2, 3) should match.</li>
                        <li>We are encouraging functional programming style, which in this case means favoring the list reporters over the list commands. Make sure that students understand, for example, that <code>all but first of</code> makes a new list; the original list given as its input is not modified.</li>
                        <li>One advantage of functional programming is that list mutation gives rise to the possibility of circular structures:<br /><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/circular.png" alt="replace item (3) of (foo) with (foo)" title="replace item (3) of (foo) with (foo)" /><br />This won't come up in the curriculum, but some students may try it anyway.  It won't break Snap<em>!</em>, but encourage such students to play with circularity on their own time.</li>
