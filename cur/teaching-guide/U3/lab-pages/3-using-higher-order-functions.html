		<p>Students go right into working with Snap<em>!</em> in the very first class. Take care of mandatory first-day-of-school business, making sure to leave students with 30-40 minutes to do their first lab, in which they set up their Snap<em>!</em> accounts.</p> 
		<p>As the first class and the first lab, it is important that students know what is expected of them. Labs are intended to be times during which students work at their own pace (in pairs). They should know that they are responsible for getting through the material in the section, but that they are also free to explore and create if something interests them. Occasionally, there are prompts in the labs directing students to post their work, whether it be to a Google classroom feed, Piazza, or some other platform. Allow time for the students (and yourself) to get used to the technology. Expect glitches, and also model the necessary patience and perseverance necessary to work with new technology.</p>
