        <h2>Programming Lab 3: Developing More Complex Programs</h2>
        <p>In Lab 3, students build two  complex games, focusing almost exclusively on ideas of <strong>abstraction</strong> to serve the goals  writing clear, debuggable, improvable code&mdash;all essential for developing complex programs. They are given goals and specifications for the programs&mdash;and are given guidance on <em>structuring</em> the programs&mdash;but must find their own ways to build the parts. Both the game board project and the number-guessing-game project are very extensible and modifiable and may lead students to their own ideas.</p>
    <p>There is little new <span class="snap">snap</span> code in Lab 3. Even the idea of abstraction&mdash;analyzing a task to find its chunks or component parts or special cases  and then build blocks that <em>specialize</em> in each of them&mdash;is not really new. Students did that when they built <code>plural</code>. But making a <em>habit</em> of analyzing and chunking tasks takes time and experience. </p>
        <p>The lab ends with three shorter activities&mdash;essentially how-to's&mdash;showing techniques that can be useful in more complex programming tasks.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Pacing:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>The first three pages of this lab (Developing a Board Game, Developing a Number Guessing Game, and Brick Wall) are the most important. Plan with the hopes of doing the last three pages as well, but if students get involved in extensions of the first three pages, give that the priority and feel free to  condense the last three.</li>
                <li>Ideally, the last three pages. all short, could be done in a single period, with page 6 done before page 5. The <strong>Tips</strong> section below suggests how.</li>
            </ul>

        	<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
        	<ul>
            	<li>The tools developed in this unit anticipate a variety of games that students will be able to develop: tic-tac-toe, magic-square games, and others. More powerful programming techniques&mdash;particularly <strong>lists</strong> which are the major new programming idea in Unit 3&mdash;are useful in completing these games.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Build some tools for board games: a block to draw square arrays of various sizes for the game board, and a block that determines which cell within that array where the sprite is in.</li>
                <li>Build a number guessing game in which the user tries to guess the computer's secret number, and the computer tries to respond with as human-like dialogue as the programmer can build.</li>
                <li>Experience the idea of abstraction in the context of developing blocks that specialize.</li>
                <li>Learn how to specify the type of input that a block is expecting to receive.</li>
                <li>Get practice composing functions.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <div><ul>
          <li><strong>Page 1: Developing a board game</strong>. This  is the most complicated project in units 1 and 2, but students are given enough subtasks to make it likely that, <em>working together</em>, they can succeed. Working together is key. Some will figure out how to solve certain parts, and others will figure out how to solve other parts. Sharing, they will learn from each other.</li>
          <li><em>What do I do when a student asks how to solve a problem?</em> There will almost certainly be parts of some of these projects that <em>you</em> don't quickly see how to do. But even when you <em>do</em> know how to solve the problem, the most useful answer you can give is often one of these
          	<ol> 
              <li>Show me what you've already figured out.</li>
          	  <li>What are the <em>parts</em> of the problem that need to be built? </li>
          	  <li>Is there a good starting place (or a thing to do next), something really simple that will get us a bit closer?</li></ol></li>
       
            <li>To avoid overloading the text, the orange box about abstraction doesn't  mention  that even building the board out of boxes is an abstraction-based design decision. That's not how you draw a tic-tac-toe board by hand; you draw long intersecting lines. We could have done that here, too, but wanted a <code>draw tile</code> block that could be modified later.</li>
            <li><strong>Page 2: Developing a number guessing game</strong>. This involves simpler coding, but is very open to students' creative ideas.</li>
            <li><strong>Page 3: Brick wall</strong>. This involves the simplest coding of the three projects, but contains a <strong>key idea</strong> about abstraction. The suggestion to create a <code>draw mortar</code> block is important. It shows how editing <em>one</em> block can update a program in many places. Also, although the coding is simple, figuring out how to make row B's length come out right is a hurdle.</li>
            <li><strong>Page 4: Input types</strong>. The information&mdash;how to constrain a block's inputs  to expect only numbers&mdash;is useful but not essential. Consider <em>demonstrating</em> the method yourself, and having students watch you and follow along. They may find learning from you faster and better than  working through the page.</li>
            <li>Input types in Snap<em>!</em> are <em>program documentation,</em> not constraints on the programmer. You can drop any reporter into any input slot. The input slot shapes are just hints about what the block expects. Don't emphasize type checking. It's really important for a programmer to understand the domain and range of each function, but the domain is often different from the language's types, e.g., &quot;an even positive integer&quot; or &quot;a word of no more than eight letters&quot; or &quot;a list whose items are either Booleans or lists.&quot;</li>
            <li><strong>Page 6: Analyzing various definitions of <code>&gt;=</code></strong>. The main point  is for students to see that it's worthwhile learning the Boolean operators. The fourth definition is exactly how you'd explain the <code>&gt;=</code> function in English. By contrast, the versions using <code>if</code> bear no relation to the way you'd think about the function in a non-programming context. Because this page requires no&mdash;it is entirely discussion&mdash;you may want to do this right after showing <strong>Input types</strong>, while the whole class is working together. Then let students loose to work on Page 5.</li>
            <li><strong>Page 5: Composition of functions</strong>. This extremely short page is very useful practice both in problem solving and in programming. It also foreshadows the way associative operators can be composed by the <code>combine</code> function in Unit 3.</li>
