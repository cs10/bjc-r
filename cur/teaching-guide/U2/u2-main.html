        <div class="sidenoteBig">In preparation for Week 5:
            <ul>
            <li>The first time you teach this unit, do the first few two or three problems on each page of programming labs 1 and 2 yourself, to get a sense of the time it might take and to remind you of the contents.</li>
            <li>One focus of this entire unit is analyzing the task, breaking it into simpler chunks, and building those chunks independently. A second focus is debugging. One useful way to help when students get stuck is for you <em>not</em> to &quot;know&quot; the answer. You can be a bit &quot;slow&quot; in understanding their program and &quot;naive&quot; about solving the problem. Ask questions like &quot;What is it <em>supposed</em> to do?&quot; &quot;What <em>is</em> it doing?&quot; &quot;What part of your result don't you like?&quot; &quot;What part of your program could possibly be doing <em>that</em>?&quot; &quot;Explain your script. What is each block doing?&quot; &quot;Can you make something that does <em>almost</em> what you want?&quot; &quot;Who got problem <em>x</em>? Can you explain how you did it?&quot;</li>
            <li>Some of the projects will have subtleties, and/or will be slightly more complex than in unit 1. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div>During Week 5,  students will work on Labs 1-2 of Unit 2.
