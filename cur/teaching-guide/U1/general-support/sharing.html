		<h2>Sharing</h2>
		
        <h3>Pair Programming Files</h3>

        <p>
            How to share...
	        <ul>
				<li><strong>In the file menu, click open, and find, select, and share the desired project file.</strong> You can then send the project URL to other people and it will be accessible (they will get a copy they should save to their own account).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>The Snap<em>!</em> development team is working on the capability for joint ownership of projects (so pair programmers can share between two accounts in the cloud). For now...
        	<ul>
            	<li>With class activities, one owner is ok. Submitted projects should indicate all authors.</li>
                <li>If students are working on projects separately outside of class, they should share their file across accounts. Though their copies will diverge, they can pair program together again later by chosing one version and integrating ideas from the other.</li> 
           	</ul>

        <h3>Class Discussion</h3>
        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/share-your-work.png" alt="Share Your Work" title="Share Your Work" />
        <p><strong>Identify interesting, elegant, and varied student solution approaches and discuss them as a class</strong>. Solicit class reactions and encourage constructive feedback.</p>
        <p>You can also invite students to volunteer to present their own projects, though in general, it is better to be guided by a specific purpose. If asking for volunteers, do so at the end of the sharing time to give the opportunity to those who haven't yet seen their work displayed.</p>
        <p>If many students struggled to get their code to work, it might be useful to share several examples of students who got parts of the program correct (or who got close) and then discuss what else they might try next. (Also, please send feedback to the curriculum developers.)</p>
