                <li><strong>Make a Prediction</strong><br /> Students predict the result of a piece of code. Students reason through the logic of code. Teachers might use these to introduce a <strong>new concept</strong> or address a common <strong>misconception</strong>. Students reason through the code without the use of a computer. The code may include elements they have not yet used or complicated logic to sort through.
    </li>
                <li><strong>Debugging</strong><br /> Students are presented with code containing an error and must <strong>debug</strong> it. Students gain experience with debugging and must make sense of code. Teachers might use these to point to a common pitfall or teach a debugging strategy. Students reason through code without the use of a computer. The code includes bugs for students to resolve.</li>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/extras/openers.html#computingnews"><strong>Computing in the News</strong></a><br />  Students are presented with and discuss a current <strong>news</strong> story about computing. Students gain a greater sense of the relevance of computing in society, are exposed to complex social issues, and learn to read news stories with an informed and critial eye. (More about this <a href="computingnews">below</a>.)</li>
                <li><strong>Snap Judgment</strong><br /> Students <strong>write</strong> down their view in response to a prompt about a Social Implications topic. This is not meant to be polished writing, or even take a view that students firmly believe. The purpose is to engage students and support written communication skills. Throughout the year, students should develop their ability to state a position and provide evidence to support it.</li>

                        <li>If you subscribe to this newsletter, it will deliver a digest to your inbox three times a week. There are a range of topics, and going through this email with students is one way to conduct a Computing in the News opener. This is a good way to touch on a wide variety of computing ideas and areas of interest for students.</li>

                        <li>Going to a news site and skimming through an interesting article together is another way to conduct a Computing in the News opener. Go through the article, highlighting some major points, then ask students to respond to some of the ideas. </li>
