                    Snap Judgment: <strong>Should violent video games be sold to minors?</strong> <br />
                    This question is the subject of an article that students will read today in class. Students again must construct an argument to support a position. Emphasize the importance of providing reasons and considering counterarguments that might be made by the other side.

                    Snap Judgment: <strong>Is technology good or bad?</strong> <br />
                    Technology is not all good or all bad. In this Snap Judgment assignment, look for ways that students use evidence to support claims they make about positive advancements or negative implications of technology. This is not meant to be a polished piece of writing but should result in students thinking of examples to support their position. In class, they will read pages 13-17 of Blown to Bits which addresses both sides.
