					In this lab, there are a couple of handwavy algorithm descriptions looking like this:<br /><br>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/white-box.png" alt="not-quite-code in white background box"><br />
                    Please avoid describing this as &quot;pseudocode,&quot; and <em>definitely </em>don't ask students to write pseudocode! We use these code descriptions <em>sparingly</em> as a pedagogic tool when we want to avoid telling students exactly how to code something, not because we think programmers should write things like this. &quot;Pseudocode&quot; is used by people who have to cope with terrible programming languages that are so loaded with syntax that actual code is unreadable. There's nothing beautiful or joyful about it.</li>
