        <h3>Research</h3>

        <strong>Guiding Question</strong>: What does Tanya Rider's story have to do with the explosion of bits?</p>
        <p>Much of <em>Blown to Bits</em> has to do with the balance between the abundance of digital information and our attempts for retaining privacy and ownership of our own information. Have students read the selection with the guiding question in mind, then discuss briefly. Students may also be interested in looking up news stories or videos about Tanya Rider. Examples:
        <ul>
        	<li><a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/local/10247516.html">Sheriff apologizes to husband of trapped woman (Komo News)</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/09/experience-trapped-in-ravine">Experience: I was trapped in a ravine for eight days (The Guardian)</a></li></ul> </p>

            </ul></div>
            
        <h3>Prepare</h3>
        <div>
        <ul>
        	<li>There are many options for students to access <em>Blown to Bits</em>. They can read it as an <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter1.pdf">online PDF</a> or you may choose to purchase hard copies of the book. You may also photocopy the book for students so that they can make annotations as they read.</li>
            <li>As students finish making their Kaleidoscope program, they should save their work and submit it. It is up to you whether you want to assign grades for this work, but at the very least, you will use their submitted work during <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/old/lesson05.html">Lesson 5</a> during a sharing session that gives students an opportunity to see each others' work. 
            <ul>
            	<li>Before class, find a method for students to submit <span class="snap">snap</span> projects that makes sense to you. Here's one suggestion: In <span class="snap">snap</span>, students can choose "Export project..." from the file menu. This brings up text in XML. Students can right-click on the page and "Save As..." to a local folder. Give students directions on naming their files (e.g. Kaleidoscope-first-last.xml), then have them send this file to you. When you go to display their work, you can open <span class="snap">snap</span>, then choose "Import..." and the file.</li>
                <li>During class, take note of interesting approaches or creative ideas that would be interesting to share. As you will see, it's difficult to "browse" through projects from the .xml files, so it's good to have a sense of whose projects you'd like to share. Consider also asking students to submit yet-incomplete kaleidoscopes (give them some way of indicating this in the file name) if you see an interesting intermediate attempt that would spark discussion.</li>
