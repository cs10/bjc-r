                	Make a Prediction: Ask students to predict what this script does. Students may notice the "hat" block, which here names the procedure being defined, <code>count up (num)</code>. From their work with <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-control-commands/3-the-for-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html" target="_blank">the <code>for</code> block</a>, students will likely be able to determine that this script "says" the numbers from 1 to <code>num</code> each for 1 second. (Lab 3)<br />

                	Make a Prediction: Discuss how this block with behave and the names of and relationships among the different block types used. This script includes commands including a loop and a conditional and reporters including <code>x position</code> and <code>y position</code>, which are both used in a command, and <code>mouse down?</code>, a predicate within a conditional.
