    	<h2>Programming Lab 2: Sprite Drawing and Communication</h2>
        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-square.png" alt="pen down, repeat 4 (move 50 steps, turn CW 90 degrees)" title="pen down, repeat 4 (move 50 steps, turn CW 90 degrees)" />
        <p>Students programming  sprites to move, draw, and interact. Students write a simple script to draw a square and then modify the input values and discuss the results. They create scripts in which sprites follow each other or follow the mouse around the stage. And they programming <strong>control</strong> structures such as loops and conditionals.</p>
		<p>Students build experience with loops and conditionals without yet formalizing. Resist the urge to "teach" these concepts and instead allow time for students to explore and discover how things work on their own. Lab 3: Control Commands codifies this learning.</p>
        
		
        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The 5 lab pages could be split across two or three days (65-90 minutes). Expected times to complete follow:
            <ul>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Exploring Snap Drawing and Motion</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Following with Sprites</li>
                <li>20-25 minutes on Sprites Interaction</li>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Drawing with Two Sprites</li>
                <li>5-10 minutes on More Sprite Drawing and Interaction</li>
            </ul>
        </p>


        <h3>Students will:</h3>

        	<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Drawing the square will lead to writing a command called "drawSquare" later in the Unit.</li>
                <li>Students learn more about x- and y-positions in the Unit 1 Kaleidoscope project.</li>
                <li>Students will explore loops such as <code>forever</code> and <code>repeat</code> more formally in <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-control-commands/1-the-repeat-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment" target="_blank">Lab 3</a>.</li>

                <li>
                	Create, discuss, and experiment this script to draw a square:<br />

                </li>
                <li>Create programs with multiple sprites, and program sprites to control the behavior of other sprites using the <code>tell</code> command.</li>
                <li>Use conditional statements to perform commands under certain circumstances such as <code>repeat until</code> the sprite is <code>touching?</code> another object on the stage.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Several blocks that students will use in Unit 1 including <code>tell</code> and <code>for</code> are  available only after importing tools from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu. This may change in a forthcoming update to Snap<em>!</em>, but for now remind students to <strong>import tools</strong> if a block they seek appears to be missing. </li>

                	To launch Lab 2&mdash;Make a Prediction: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UlHWatINw9crcqeA0hjDb1n-toPSNtmSfegBM5zXCbw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Repeat, Move, Turn</a>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Project the script and ask students to predict what it does (discuss in small groups and/or as a class).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The first page of this lab gives students a simple script to draw a square and asks them to experiment with it, changing various numbers in the script and observing the results. Students who are accustomed to being told exactly what to do may flounder. Tell them that Creativity is one of the CSP Big Ideas, and that in this sort of exploratory lesson there are no wrong answers.</li>
                <li>Take note of any interesting approaches or creative ideas that would be good to share with the class.                </li>
                <li>The &quot;Sprite Interaction&quot; page has a conversation in Haitian Creole, Russian, English, and Spanish. <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Russian.png" width="350"  alt="text in Creole and Russian"> Make sure students understand that they are to <em>make up their own conversation</em>. The point of this example is  to show that students can use whatever language(s) they like. Watch for students who have so used to  &quot;doing what the book says&quot; that they  get stuck trying to copy this text. Tell them to use their own creativity!</li>
                <li>The  <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-drawing-communication/5-more-drawing-interaction.html" target="_blank">More Sprite Drawing and Interaction</a> page shows Snap<em>!</em> code with comments attached. Some students may <em>want</em> to comment some of their code, for their own information, but please don't <em>require</em> students to do so. This isn't a software engineering course preparing students for the workforce. Keep the focus in this first course on the beauty and joy.</li>
