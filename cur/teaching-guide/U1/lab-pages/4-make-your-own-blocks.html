        <h2>Programming Lab 4: Building and Debugging Your Own Blocks</h2>
        <p>Students learn to create their own blocks with inputs and to use their own blocks to build others. Using blocks within blocks presages recursion (calling a procedure from within itself), which will be addressed in <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/6-recursion-trees-fractals.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 5: Recursion</a> and <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/7-recursive-reporters.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 6: Recursive Reporters</a>. In this lab, students continue to develop comfort with block programming and the Snap<em>!</em> interface as they create their own blocks and identify categories and input variables for their new blocks.</p>
        <p>Students also build  their skill with debugging, and they consider how a block that works well on its own might cause problems when used within another block. </p>


        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The 5 lab pages could be split across two or three days (55-80 minutes). Expected times to complete Lab 4 follow: <ul>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Designing Custom Blocks</li>
                <li>5-10 minutes on Adding an Input</li>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Debugging Custom Blocks</li>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Using Blocks within Blocks</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Debugging Blocks within Blocks</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Tips:</h3>

                <li>A  common slip, even among experienced Snap<em>!</em> programmers, is to forget to choose a palette/color when making a new block. The block ends up in the gray &quot;Other&quot; category. This doesn't hurt anything, but makes the block hard to find because gray blocks share a palette with Variables. To change a block's palette, edit it and click on the yellow hat block at the top of its script in the editor.</li>
                <li>It's also possible to change the <em>shape</em> of a custom block in the block editor, but only if  the block is not currently used in a script or another block and as long as it doesn't even appear in the scripting area. You must delete all such invocations (by dragging them onto the palette area) before clicking on the hat block.</li>
                <div class="comment">Should it be in the FYTD then? --MF </div>
                <li>The <code>draw polygon</code> problem in the Take It Further on the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/4-building-and-debugging/2-adding-an-input.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Adding an Input</a> page is really important; you might want to assign it to everyone. It introduces the idea of <em>generalizing patterns:</em> If you have a family of custom blocks that are mostly the same script but with a little difference in each one, you can make a single block that captures the entire family by adding an input for the part that's different. We'll use this idea many times in the course, but it's especially important in Unit 5 when the result of the generalization is a recursive procedure.</li>
                <li>Custom blocks that your students create on this page will have rectangular input slots, not oval as in the primitive (built-in) blocks, for numeric inputs. If students ask why, say that this won't affect the usability of their blocks, and that they will learn to distinguish input types in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/3-building-more-complex-blocks/4-input-types.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 2, Lab 3</a>.</li>
                <div class="comment">I wonder about the effectiveness of this message since the error messages in Snap<em>!</em> are not especially helpful... --MF</div>
                <li>About bugs: Beginning programmers sometimes treat unexpected results and error messages as signs of failure. The right way to look at them is that they're information that help you take a next step. Instead of seeing the program as &quot;no good,&quot; see it as &quot;not yet done.&quot; Creating bugs, even often, is not a sign that you are no good at programming! Bugs are normal, especially as programs become more complex. And, sometimes, bugs (and error messages) provide not only clues about how to fix the program, but ideas that can be <em>useful</em> in new programs. Experienced programmers can find bugs amusing (except when there's a deadline!) and error messages very helpful.
