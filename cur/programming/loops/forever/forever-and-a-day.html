        <p>
            From the previous exercise, you may have figured out
            what the
            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png" alt="Forever block"/>
            block does. The <b>forever</b> block is the
            first block you have see that holds, or wraps around, other blocks.
            We call this a <em>C block</em> because of its shape.  As the name <b>forever</b> implies, it will run the blocks inside it again and
            again and again and ... well, forever. You will find this block under the <b>Control</b> tab.
        </p>

        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/intro/the-person-kept-talking-and-talking.png" alt="Forever And a Day Script"/>

        <p class="quoteBlue">
            Will a
            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png" alt="Forever block"/>
            block ever stop?
            <br>
            <br>
            Not unless you tell it to: Click on the stop sign icon on the
            upper right hand corner of the Snap<i>!</i> window.
            <br>
                    <img class="indent" src="../../../../img/topic1/stopbutton.png" alt="Stop button"/>
        </p>

        <p>
            This stop sign will stop all scripts that are running in any sprite.  This is 
            equivalent to executing the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/stop-all.png" alt="stop all block">
            in the <code>Control</code> palette.
