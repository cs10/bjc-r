            What do you think the following script will do?
        </p>

            <img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/topic1_followmousescript.png" alt="Follow That Mouse Script"/>

        <p>
            Hint: 
            <img class="inline" src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_mousex.png" alt="Mouse X Reporter"/>
             and <img class="inline" src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_mousey.png" alt="Mouse Y Reporter"/> are reporters in the <b>Sensing</b>
            palette; they tell you where the mouse is pointing.
        </p>
        <p  class="quoteOrange">
            Open <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/loop/follow-that-mouse.xml" >the program</a> (click to run it). 
            Did it follow your expectations?
        </p>
        <p>
            Drag the sprite to a different part of the screen while the program is running and see what happens!
