        <p>
            A regular polygon is a shape in which all the sides
            are the same length and all the
            turning angles are the same.
            A square is a regular 4-sided polygon.

            Using a <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="empty repeat-n block" class="inline" />
            to draw the following regular shapes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Equilateral Triangle
            </li>
            <li>
                Pentagon
            </li>
            <li>
                Hexagon
            </li>
            <li>
                Octagon
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>As you draw regular polygons with more and more sides, you are
            getting closer and closer to a circle.  Is there a point
            at which is actually (mathematically?) a circle?</p>

         <!-- too hard? 
            <li>
                Five-sided Star
            </li>
        -->
        </ul>
