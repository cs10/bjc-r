	<title>Sorting a List</title>
    </head>

    <body>
	<p>Suppose we have a list of numbers like this:</p>
	<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/unsortlist.png" alt="7, 8, 1, 9, 8, 2, 7" /></p>
	<p>What we want is a list of the same numbers, in ascending order:</p>
	<p><img src="../../../../img/recur/reporters/sortlist.png" alt="1, 2, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9" /></p>
	<p>(There's no reason the items have to be numbers, as long as we have some way to order them, like the <code>&lt;</code> operator for numbers. But numbers are easiest to talk about in this context.)</p>
	<p>There are many different sorting algorithms. But the best one for recursively generated lists, and probably the most elegant, is called <em>mergesort. </em>Here's the idea in a nutshell: Divide the list in half; recursively sort each half; then merge the two sorted sublists. The base case is that an empty list or a one-item list is already sorted.</p>
	<p>The easiest way to divide a list in half turns out to be putting the odd-indexed items (first, third, fifth, etc.) in one half and the even-indexed items (second, fourth, sixth, etc.) in the other.</p>
	<p class="quoteOrange">
	    Note: this will <em>not</em> return the numbers whose <em>values</em> are even/odd, but those whose <em>positions</em> are even/odd.
	    For example, <code>evens((5, 6, 2, 4, 3, 9))</code> will report <code>(6, 4, 9)</code> and not <code>(6, 2, 4)</code>.
	</p>

	You do this with a recursion that skips over an item each time:</p>
	<p><img src="../../../../img/recur/reporters/odds.png" alt="odd items" /></p>
	<p><img src="../../../../img/recur/reporters/evenitems.png" alt="even items" /></p>
	<p>All the work here, basically, is done by the <img src="../../../../img/recur/reporters/bfbf.png" alt="all but first of all but first of" /> in <code>odd numbered items</code>. This skips the second item and makes the recursive call on items 3 through the end of the list. Note that <code>even numbered items</code> is not <em>directly </em>recursive; it calls <code>odd numbered items</code>, not itself.</p>
	<blockquote>
	    <p>☞ Why does <code>odd numbered items</code> need two base cases?</p>
	    <p>☞ Write a version of <code>even numbered items</code> that calls itself recursively instead of using <code>odd numbered items</code>.</p>
	    <p>☞ Can you write a version of <code>odd numbered items</code> that uses (the original) <code>even numbered items</code> instead of calling itself recursively? That structure (A calls B, B calls A) is called <em>mutual recursion.</em></p>
