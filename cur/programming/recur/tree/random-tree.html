		<p>
We want to make a tree that looks more random. Here are some pictures
of different runs of the program with different levels so that you can
see what we were thinking. </p>

		Unfortunately, our attempt (shown below) was unsuccessful (see the ghastly "tree" on the right). Modify the <code>crazy-tree</code> code to produce the random trees as shown above. Click on the code to get a copy of our buggy code.</p>

		<p>Hint 1: Your sprite better end up in the same position and orientation as it was before the call to crazy tree. Hint 2: you may want to create new variables
