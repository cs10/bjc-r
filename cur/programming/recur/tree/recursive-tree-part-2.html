			4. That <code>tree2a</code> block is pretty long and repetitive. But we can simplify it if we notice that in two places it has a move forward/move back pair of blocks, and that this is what <code>tree1</code> does! So we can use <code>tree1</code> to shorten <code>tree2</code>. Compare the code below to convince yourself that the new <code>tree2</code> will work the same as the original <code>tree2a</code>. <br>

		Note that the tree blocks inside this <code>tree2</code> script are <code>tree1</code> blocks, not <code>tree2</code> blocks! So there's no mysterious <code>tree</code>-using-<code>tree</code> situation here; it's not unusual for one already-written block to be used in <em>another</em> block's script. </p>
		<p>
		5. Make a <code>tree3</code> block that uses the <code>tree2</code> block, on the same pattern. You should see output that looks something like the following: 		</p>
		<img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/recur/tree-level3.jpg" alt="" title="" >
		<p>
		6. If you can stand it, make a <code>tree4</code> block that uses the <code>tree3</code> block and try it out. </p>
		<p>
			<b>This would be a good time to save your project.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
		7. These blocks all look exactly the same, don't they? So it makes sense to wonder if we can replace them all with a single <code>tree</code> block. Here's the big idea: We can write a <code>tree</code> block that uses itself in its own script <i>provided that it knows how many levels it's expected to draw!</i> So, in addition to the <code>size</code> input, it'll have a <code>levels</code> input: </p>
		<p>
		In the earlier steps, <code>tree3</code> used <code>tree2</code>; <code>tree2</code> used <code>tree1</code>. If you actually had the patience to work up to a <code>tree437</code> block, what block would it call for its two branches? To generalize the pattern, <code>tree</code> will use <code>tree</code>, but reducing the number of levels by 1:</p>
		<p><img src="../../../../img/recur/tree-nobase.png" alt="recursive tree, first version"></p>
		<p>For example, given a <code>levels</code> input of 5, <code>tree</code> will call two trees with a <code>levels</code> input of 4. Those two trees in turn will each call two more trees with a <code>levels</code> input of 3. This pattern continues on and on, with the <code>levels</code> and <code>size</code> inputs getting smaller and smaller. Ideally, we want the <code>levels</code> input to eventually reach and finish at 1, signifying our most basic tree.</p>
		<p>Now try the <code>tree</code> block. What happens? <em>Why </em>does it happen? When you know the answer, go to the next activity.
		<br>
		<em>Hint: Try to follow the <code>tree</code> block for a small <code>levels</code> input such as 3, and keep track of the decreasing <code>levels</code> input as you call more trees. Does the tree reach and finish at level 1, which is our most basic tree?</em></p>
