  <div style="text-align: left;">For our <code>tree</code> block, we're going to point out various parts of the anatomy of a recursive procedure. The line numbers mentioned below refer to the picture at the end of this page.<br><ul>
      <li>We always need a way to figure out when we're done and shouldn't call the recursive call again. Lines 2-4 are the <em>Base Case,</em> in which we handle a situation so simple that we don't need to call the block recursively.</li>
      <li>If this isn't the base case we think to ourselves "Woah &#8212; That seems complicated. I'll just do a small part of the problem and delegate to someone else". Here's what we do:<br></li>
      <ul><li>draw the trunk of the tree (line 6), <br></li>
        <li>position the sprite for the left sub-tree (line 7), <br></li>
        <li>delegate to another copy of the tree block the drawing of the left sub-tree (line 8), </li>
        <li>re-position the sprite for the right sub-tree (line 9),</li>
        <li>delegate to another copy of the tree block the drawing of the right sub-tree (line 10),</li>
        <li>re-position the sprite to retrace the trunk (line 11), and<br></li>
        <li>retrace the trunk and leave the sprite exactly where it started out (line 12).</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Lines 6-12 are the <em>Recursive Case,</em> in which the block calls itself using recursion.</li>
      <li>The <em>Recursive Case</em> also has to work <em>towards</em> the base case. This means that some input or other aspect of the recursive calls in the <em>Recursive Case</em> has to be changing such that the <em>Base Case</em> is eventually called. For our <code>tree</code> block, we are subtracting 1 from the <code>level</code> input of each recursive call, so that eventually the <code>level</code> input will reach a value of 1, which is the condition for our <em>Base Case</em>. If we cannot reach our <em>Base Case</em>, our block will keep recursively calling itself forever, getting stuck in what we call an <em>infinite loop</em>. This is what happened with our <code>tree</code> block before we modified it.</li>

    <p>Questions:</p>
    <p>1. What would happen if we ran our <code>tree</code> block with a <code>level</code> input of less than 1? Think about it before you try it out.</p>
    <p>2. Sometimes you can make a recursive procedure more elegant by having a smaller base case. In our <code>tree</code> program, what would a &quot;zero level&quot; tree mean? Try rewriting <code>tree</code> so that the base case is <code>level=0</code>.</p>
