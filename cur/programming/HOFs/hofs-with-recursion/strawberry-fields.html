        	Strawberry plants are funny. Every year they send "runners" to their left and right neighbors, which take seed and
			become an entirely new strawberry plant the next year. We'd like to model this process and count how many strawberry
			plants we'll have in our garden (that we've divided into columns, like the number line) starting from a single strawberry
			plant in column 0 in year 1, the top row. All other numbers in the top row are 0 (no other strawberry plants). The number
			in every subsequent row is the sum of the three numbers directly above it, to the above left and to the above right as
			shown below. We've filled in the table for years 1 through 5:

        </p>
        
        <p>
        	Let's write a block <img src="../../../../img/hof/plants.png" alt="Plants (column, year)"/> (framework under the "Plants" sprite)
            that takes in a column and year and reports
            the number of plants that will be in that column in that year. We don't want to be too specific, however. It's possible
            that a new scientific discovery will reveal that strawberry plants actually grow out in many directions, or only grow every
            other year. Just to be safe, we've defined the lists <code>COLUMNS</code> and <code>YEARS</code> that tell us exactly
            how each count depends on the other, previous counts. In the above example, <code>COLUMNS</code> would be defined as
            <code>(-1 0 1)</code> and <code>YEARS</code> as <code>(-1 -1 -1)</code>. This illustration should help clarify
            why we have chosen these particular values of <code>COLUMNS</code> and <code>YEARS</code>.<br/>
            <img src="../../../../img/hof/columns-years-illustration.png" alt="illustration of columns and years"/>
            <br/>However, these lists could be 1 item long, or 20 items long. Make sure to make your block general enough to
            handle any of these possibilities. You'll definitely find HOFs helpful here.

        <p>
        	Reminder: <code>map</code> can take in
            multiple lists, as long as the reporter given takes in the same number of inputs as there are lists. For example,
        </p>
        <p><img src="../../../../img/hof/map-over-cal-stan-fran.png" alt="map (join(_)) over (cal, stan, fran) (ifornia, ford, cisco)"/></p>
        <p>    
	        will report the list <code>("california", "stanford", "francisco")</code>.
