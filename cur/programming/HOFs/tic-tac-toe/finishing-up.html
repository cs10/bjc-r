Now that we have our three primary strategies for the computer, it's time to put them all together.<br><br>Make the block <span style="font-style: italic;">ttt-choose</span>, which the main block, <span style="font-style: italic;">ttt</span>, will contain, that goes through each strategy. If a strategy does not return false, then the computer should use that strategy to make its next move. ttt-choose takes in two inputs, triples and the computer's piece. (X or O). It should return the best move.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" title="ttt-choose" alt="ttt-choose" src="/bjc-r/img/hof/ttt-choose-block.png" ><br></div><br></body></html>
