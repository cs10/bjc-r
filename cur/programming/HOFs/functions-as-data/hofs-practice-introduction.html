        <title>HOFs Practice and Treating Functions as Data</title>
      
   </head>

        <p>
            In the lists labs and your previous assignments, you've been exposed to HOF blocks like <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and
            <code>combine</code>.
            You likely used them to carry out relatively simple tasks, like summing a list with <code>combine</code>, or filtering based on word length 
            with <code>keep</code>.
            In this lab, you're going to attack some more complicated problems with the help of HOFs. In addition, you're going to see how functions
            can be treated as data, and how you can define your own blocks that take in functions as input, just like <code>map</code>,
            <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code> do.
