            In math and engineering, it is often necessary to find the minimum or maximum of a function over a range of values. Calculus gives us tools
            (like derivatives) to exactly calculate these values. However, in many scientific applications, it can be equally useful to simply find an
            approximate solution. For example, we might think up a few possible values, and plug them into the function to see which
            output is the smallest or largest.
            Write a block that takes in a function and a list of inputs, and finds the minimum of that function over those inputs.
            As usual, attempt this without using recursion or iteration - only HOFs.

            Now, let's put our function to use. Using it and functions written earlier, have the sprite say the minimum of the function
            <code>f(n) = (1021 * n) mod 101</code>
            for all factorions between 1 and 150. <i>Hint: the sprite should say 11</i>.
