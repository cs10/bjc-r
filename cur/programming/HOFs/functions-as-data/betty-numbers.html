            We'll call a number a betty number if each of its digits is at least as large as the digit before it. This means
            that there are no digits that decrease in value as the number is read from left to right (so all single-digit numbers
            are betty numbers). Write a predicate that determines whether any positive number is a betty number; you may use
            any techniques you'ver learned in this class:  recursion, higher-order functions, iteration, etc.

        <p>
            Some betty numbers: 14789, 45, 47899, 1122334, 3 <br/>
            Some non-betty numbers: 12342, 9876, 152
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Next, write a block that returns a list containing all of the betty numbers in a given range.

            Wait! Doesn't this sound pretty familiar? Try solving this one with the help of the nice generalized block we built on the last page.

        <p>
            The beauty of abstraction: build once, use over and over again! When we wrote the <code>list all numbers with property</code> block, we didn't know
            that betty numbers existed! But since we generalized properly, we were able to use the block to solve a future problem.
