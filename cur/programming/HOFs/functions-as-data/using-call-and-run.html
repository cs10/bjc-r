        <title>Functions as Data - Call and Run</title>

        <p>
            At this point, you may be wondering "what's the point of treating functions as data? Isn't the point of functions to call them?".
            Enter <code>call</code> and <code>run</code>. These two blocks are the inverse of the gray border. They take a function, and evaluate it for us.
            The only difference between <code>call</code> and <code>run</code> is that <code>call</code> is for reporter blocks, and <code>run</code>
            is for command blocks.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Call takes in a function and inputs, and applies the function to those inputs.
            For example
            <br/> <img src="../../../../img/hof/call-minus.png" alt="call gray-border(_-_) with inputs 5 2"/> <br/>
            is equivalent to
            <br/> <img src="../../../../img/hof/directly-compute-5-2.png" alt="5 - 2"/> <br/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We can even use <code>call</code> on variables and list items!
            
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../../img/hof/call-variable.png" alt="call function-as-data with inputs 5 2"/> <br/>
            <br/> <img src="../../../../img/hof/call-list-item.png" alt="call item 2 of list with inputs 5 2"/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Notice, however, that the inputs in these two <code>call</code> blocks <u>do not</u> have gray borders!
            This is because the two inputs already were "ringified" when they were set to a variable or added to a list.
            To get rid of the ring, you can right-click on the block and select "unringify."
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As mentioned above, <code>run</code> works on command blocks. Example:
            <br/> <img src="../../../../img/hof/run-say.png" alt="run gray-border(say _ for 2 seconds) with inputs Hello!"/> <br/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The example below is a homemade HOF! It takes in a function that draws some type of line,
            and uses that block to draw a tree.
            <br/><img src="../../../../img/hof/general-tree.png" alt="block definition for draw tree with size, levels, line-type"/> <br/>
            We run it like this:
            <br/> <img src="../../../../img/hof/draw-tree-simple.png" alt="draw tree with 80, 3, simple line"/> <br/>
            or this:
            <br/> <img src="../../../../img/hof/draw-tree-zig-zag.png" alt="draw tree with 80, 3, zig-zag"/> <br/>
            
            Try it out with the functions provided in the starter file,
            and then try making your own function that draws a different type of line.
            When making your own HOF blocks, you can get the gray-border input by clicking the input name in the block editor,
            then clicking the dropdown arrow. You'll be able to select "command" or "reporter" as the input type.
