        <p>
            Have you ever wondered why the blocks <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code> are called "higher-order functions" (HOFs)?
            The reason we use this term is that these "higher-order functions" take functions (blocks) as inputs. They are "higher-order" because they
            are functions that themselves operate on functions!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            What else can we pass into functions? Strings, lists, and numbers are a few examples. What are these things? They are types of <u>data</u>.
            Since we can also pass functions into other functions, aren't they just like any other kind of data? In fact, they are!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If functions are really just a kind of data, what can we do with them? Well, what can we do with other types of data?
            We can assign them to variables, add them to lists, say them, and report them from reporter blocks.
            We can do all of these things with functions, too!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Take a look at the "HOFs" sprite in your starter file. The first thing you should see is
            <br/> <img src="../../../../img/hof/function-as-variable.png" alt="set function-as-data to gray-border(_+_)"/> <br/>
            Here, we are setting a variable to a function (in this case, the <code>plus</code> block). Notice anything special?
            The <code>plus</code> block is inside a gray ring. You may recogize this from <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and
            <code>combine</code>. This gray border tells <span class='snap'>Snap</span> that the block inside should not be evaluated,
            but stored as the block itself. If we didn't have the gray border, the variable would just be set to 0. The gray border can be
            found in the green operators tab. Notice that there's one for each type of block: command, reporter, and predicate.
        </p>

            Looking at the scripts for this sprite, you should also see how we can add functions to a list
            <br/> <img src="../../../../img/hof/add-functions-to-list.png" alt="adding various functions to a list"/>
            <img src="../../../../img/hof/list-of-functions.png" alt="resulting list"/> <br/>
            say them
            <br/> <img src="../../../../img/hof/say-a-function.png" alt="function in a say block"/> <br/>
            and report them
            <br/> <img src="../../../../img/hof/report-a-function.png" alt="function reporting a function"/> <br/>
        </p>
