            <div><span>2:</span> Oh, and then it plays the note <em>n</em> for a quarter of  beat! That "point two five beats" is a quarter note!</div>

                	<strong><em>Command</em> blocks perform an action</strong> (like drawing on the stage or having the sprite say something). Commands have the click-together groove and bump at the top and bottom:<br />

            <p>The three oval-shaped reporters at the bottom of the Motion palette have checkboxes for <strong>watchers</strong>.  Unlike the jigsaw-puzzle-shaped command blocks, reporters don't carry out an action (such as moving the sprite  or displaying a speech balloon).  Instead, they <em>report a value</em>, usually for use in another block's input slot.</p>
            <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/watchers-on-stage.gif" alt="position and direction watchers on the stage" title="position and direction watchers on the stage" />
            <p>If you click the reporters, they will tell you their value (in this case, where the sprite is positioned on the stage). If you check  the boxes next to them, their values will be displayed in a <strong>watcher</strong> on the stage. As in algebra, <em>x</em> means left-to-right position, and <em>y</em> means bottom-to-top position. Once you put a watcher on the stage, the value it displays will be kept up to date as your program runs. (You can uncheck the box to remove a watcher from the stage.)</p>
            <p>There are reporters with checkboxes for watchers in several of the Snap<em>!</em> palettes.</p>
        </div>
                 
    	<p>Like other reporter blocks, the <code>random</code> block reports a value that you can use as input to other blocks:</p>
