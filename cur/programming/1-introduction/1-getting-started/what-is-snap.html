		<h2>What is <span class="snap">snap</span> ?</h2>
        <div>
            <span class="snap">snap</span> is a programming language, a language for writing computer programs. Programs are sets of instructions for the computer to follow, telling it what to do.

        	When the first programming languages were invented, video screens were rare, and people communicated with computers mostly through a keyboard. Because of that history, most programming languages still use a keyboard. <span class="snap">snap</span> is newer: it's a visual language. Instead of writing a program  using only the keyboard, you will build the program by dragging pictures of blocks (instructions) and clicking them together.
