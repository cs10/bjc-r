        <div>We can use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="empty repeat-n block" class="inline" /> block to make drawing shapes easier. The script below draws a square.</div>

                <li>There are three different numeric values in the script&mdash;<code>4</code>, <code>100</code>, and <code>90</code>&mdash;that you can think of as <strong>parameters</strong> that change the resulting picture.

                <li>Through how many degrees did your sprite turn <em>altogether</em> (not per side) when you drew the triangle? (That is, ignore the <code>move</code> blocks and focus on only the <code>turn</code> blocks).</li>
                <li>
                	What number you can put into the blank numeric input of the <code>repeat</code> block below to produce the picture shown?<br/ >

        	<ul>
                <li>As you draw regular polygons with more and more sides, you are getting closer and closer to a circle.  Is there a point at which is actually, mathematically a circle?</li>
            	<li>
                	<div class="sidenote">
                    	<div>
                        	A regular star is closely related to a pentagon, and a turning angle of 360 &divide; 5 = 72&deg; draws a regular pentagon.<br /><br />
                        	Use the <code>turn</code> block <em>before</em> the <code>repeat</code> block so that the star isn't drawn tilted, but don't worry about this until you have the other <code>turn</code> block figured out.

                    Complete the code below to draw a star.<br/>

        </div>
		<div> It is also possible to <em>nest</em> one <code>repeat</code> block inside another. Since <span class="snap">snap</span> processes scripts from top to bottom, the first <code>repeat</code> will begin first, and the second <code>repeat</code> will have to complete its entire process before the process of the first <code>repeat</code> is called again.</div>
