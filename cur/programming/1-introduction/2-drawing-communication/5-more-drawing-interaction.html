                    Start with one sprite and give it these scripts:<br />
                	<div class="sidenote">You don't <em>need</em> to add the comments that are in yellow boxes on the side.</div>
                    <div class="sidenote">But you <em>can</em> add comments to any script by right-clicking (or control-clicking) on the scripting area's gray background <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/gray-background-of-scripting-area.png" alt="picture of gray background"> and selecting "add comment."</div>

                </li>
                <li>
                	Now <em>duplicate</em> that sprite by right-clicking (or control-clicking) on the sprite's <em>button</em> below the stage (not the sprite itself) and selecting "duplicate".<br />
                    <div class="sideHOMbig"><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-drawing-communication/2-following-sprites.html#newTurtle" target="_blank">Earlier</a>, you created a brand new sprite using <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Add-a-new-turtle-sprite.png"    alt="add a new turtle sprite">. That sprite had no scripts because it was brand new. This time, you <em>duplicated</em> an existing sprite. So, the duplicated sprite gets all the code that the original sprite had.</div>

                <li>Change Sprite(2)'s scripts so that it will set the pen color to red, point in direction 180, and move 5 (not -5) steps.</li>
                <li>Change Sprite(2)'s scripts so that it points towards Sprite. Then change Sprite's scripts so that it points towards Sprite(2).</li>
                <li>What happens when the "r" key is pressed?</li>
                <li>What happens when the "space" key is pressed?</li>
                <li><strong>Experiment: </strong>Change Sprite's scripts so that it backs away only 4 steps instead of 5. <!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move -4 steps.png" alt="move -4 steps">--> Reset and start the program again to see what happens.</li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
 Discuss what happens and why.</li>
