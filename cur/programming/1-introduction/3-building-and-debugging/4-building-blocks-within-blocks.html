    	<h2>Using Blocks within Blocks</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <ul>
                <li>GitHub comment: In the "For You To Do" section it is unclear how one needs to incorportate the [draw square_] block into the [draw square-petal flower with_ petals of size_]. The image above this section I have drawn using [repeat 6] [turn 60 degrees] +[draw square] but it is unclear on how to create the new block that accepts inputs for the # of petals and the size of petals.</li>
                <li>GH: the blocks should have numeric input as an example</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>You can treat your custom-made blocks like any other block in snap, including using them within other blocks you define. You may have already done that at least once if you wrote <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-building-and-debugging/1-custom-blocks.html#further" target="_blank">the <code>house</code> block</a>. </p>
        <div class="takeNote">The best way to solve bigger programming tasks is often to write simpler blocks that are used within slightly more complicated blocks, which are in turn used in even more complicated blocks, and so on. When you build blocks made of other blocks you've built, this is called <strong>composition</strong> of blocks.</div>

                    <p>Write simple custom blocks, or borrow from blocks you have already written, and then use those blocks inside your <code>draw a flower</code> block.  If you can, write blocks of intermediate complexity that use and are used by other blocks you write.</p>
            		<p>
                    	You might write:
                    	<ul>
                        	<li><code>draw flower head with ...</code></li>
                            <li><code>draw stem with length []</code></li>
                        </ul>
                        but don't feel constrained by this list.
                    </p>
                    <p>Use several inputs that control aspects of what the flower should look like.  You might change the number of petals...</p>

                <li>Use <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-building-and-debugging/2-adding-an-input.html#drawsquare" target="_blank">the <img class="block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/draw-square-empty-parameter.png" alt="empty square ()" title="empty square ()" /> block</a> to create a block <img class="block" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-square-petal-flower-empty-parameters.png" alt="360 divided by the number of petals"> that will draw a  flower with square petals, like the one shown here, but with any specified number of square-shaped petals of the specified size.

If you see something you like, spend some time trying to incorporate that design into your program.</div>

                        You could also use <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/drawing/draw-field-of-flowers-with-backgrounds.xml">this starter project</a>, which contains a few relevant backgrounds.  To use them, click on the "Stage" sprite at the lower right of the <span class="snap">snap</span> window, select the "Costumes" tab at the top of the scripting area, and select the background that you want for your program.
