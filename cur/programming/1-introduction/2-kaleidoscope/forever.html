             The <code>forever</code> block is the first block you have seen that holds, or wraps around, other blocks. We call this a <strong>C block</strong> because of its shape.  As the name "forever" implies, it will run the blocks inside it again and again and again and ... well, forever.
        </div>

        You can stop all scripts by clicking on the stop sign <img src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/stopbutton.png" class="indent" alt="Stop button"/> at the top right  corner of the <span class="snap">snap</span> window. This is equivalent to executing the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/stop-all.png" class="block" alt="stop all block"> in the "Control" palette.
