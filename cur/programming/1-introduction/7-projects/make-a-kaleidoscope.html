        <h2>Making a Kaleidoscope</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
        	<ul>
                <li>JK: Check out <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/watertown.k12.ma.us/riling-whs-math/home/programming">this Watertown teacher's site</a> for some neat Kaleidoscope student projects.</li>
                <li>too much magic with d, u, and c. This is too much. Start with building a script that you can write with (mimic U2 two-tone mouse script), any maybe put in a two sprite "mirroring" program later in the unit. Maybe some costuming in U1? Probably need to introduce multiple sprites toward the end of U1 so that PG can do some multiple sprite stuff in U2. (Costumes are not necessary, but could do.)</li>
                <li>BH: After playing with those Watertown projects, I find I don't like using D and U keys to control the pen(s). I think we should do <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/mouse.png" width="245" height="162" alt="use mouse button to control pen"></li>
            </ul>
		</div>
        <p><a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/drawing/kaleidoscope.xml">Here is a drawing program</a> to explore. The main part of it is:</p>
        <div class="sidenote">The <em>hat</em> shaped blocks, which can be used only at the top of a script, tell when to run that script. </div>
        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/follow-that-mouse-when-space.png" alt="Kaleidoscope Script"/> 
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Click on the link above to open the template code.</li>
                <li>You've used part of this script before and know what it does. The new part is <code>when space key pressed</code>. Experiment to see what that does.</li>
                <li> Now, while you are moving your mouse over the stage, use the <strong>d</strong>, <strong>u</strong>, and <strong>c</strong> keys to control what gets drawn. Can you get the sprite to write your name?</li>
                <img class="imageLeft" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" /> <br clear="all" />
				<li> Now you get to invent a script on your own to make a (kind of) kaleidoscope, like this:<br />
                	<div class="sidenote">One sprite is following the mouse. Three other sprites are reflecting the movement of that sprite in slightly different ways.</div>

                    Some useful information:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You  need four sprites. One way to create the others is to <em>duplicate</em> the one you have. Right-click the sprite-button in the sprite corral, and select "duplicate" from the <em>context menu</em> that appears. Each duplicated sprite will have  the same scripts as the original, which is why duplication is easier than creating new sprites from scratch.</li>
                        <li>Click on any sprite in the corral to see its script. They will all be the same at first but you will modify three of them to change the color and create the reflections. </li>
                        <li>To change the color, click the color input in that sprite's <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-pen-color.png" class="block" alt="Set Pen to Color X Block"/>  block, choose whatever color you like, and then click on  the block itself (to run the block and actually set the color). </li>
                        <li>To change how they move, you will need to modify the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> inputs in each sprite's <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y-0-0.png" class="inline" alt="go to x: () y: ()" title="go to x: () y: ()"/> block using <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/plus.png" alt="() + ()" title="() + ()" /> or <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/minus.png" alt="() - ()" title="() - ()" />.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><div class="saveAs"><span class="text">"U1-Kaleidoscope"</span><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-this-as.png" alt="Save your work as U1L2-Kaleidoscope" title="Save your work as U1L2-Kaleidoscope" /></div></li>
