                <li>GH Feedback 10/16/15: Its not clear that "spell" is a new block that students have to create. They're spending time looking for it and it doesn't exist.</li>

        <p>In casual conversations, we sometimes trip on a word or say not quite what we mean. The other person  usually  understands anyway, and may not even notice the slip. Computers are not yet that smart! In programming, whatever we say—even if it's not what we meant—the computer tries to do. If it can't, it might  report an error, or it might just give a wrong answer. Programmers call errors in their code "bugs,"  parts of the program that don't do what the programmer intended or that cause some other part of the program not to behave as intended. The process of finding and fixing bugs is called "debugging."</p>

                <p>But it doesn't work quite right. Here is its definition.</p>
