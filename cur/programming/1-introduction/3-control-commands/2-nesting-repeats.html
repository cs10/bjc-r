                <li>GH Feedback 8/30: I'm not thrilled with the REPEAT 0 block in the quiz. I get the point, but is there some other way to make it? I'm not a fan of making examples with code that nobody would ever want to write.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 8/30: More of a question - Should the triangles exercise be something they turn in? Seems like it's somewhat involved, and a good example of abstraction.</li>

        </div>
        <p> It is also possible to <em>nest</em> one <code>repeat</code> block inside another. Since Snap<em>!</em> processes scripts from top to bottom, the first <code>repeat</code> will begin first, and the second <code>repeat</code> will have to complete all its repetitions before the    first <code>repeat</code> continues.</p>

                	Build a script that draws a red triangle, duplicate it twice, and make the two new scripts draw a smaller blue triangle and an even smaller green one. 
                    <ul>
                    	<li>To duplicate a script, right-click (or control-click) on the first block of the script (in this case, the <code>repeat</code> block) and choose "duplicate".</li>

                            Then, change the inputs as the video shows:<br />

                    Now, insert the entire script for the blue triangle between the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> blocks of the red triangle, like this. <br />
