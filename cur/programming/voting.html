        As we head into October, Election Day is a little over a month away, we would like to encourage you to please register to vote if you can. Not only is voting your right and privilege, it is also one of the ways to make your voice heard and push for the changes you want to see both locally and nationally. As college students and young voters, our votes could have a significant impact; therefore, if you are willing and able, please cast a vote in the upcoming election for yourself, your future, people you care about, and those who cannot vote.
