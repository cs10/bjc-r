We want to have the character read all of the names from our <tt>players</tt> list.  This is a very common type of problem when dealing with lists: we want to do the same thing for each item in the list.  To tackle this problem, we are going to use a variable called <tt>index</tt> to keep track of the position of the element in the list we are processing.

<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<img border="0" title="Reading the names of the players in the list" alt="Reading the names of the players in the list" src="{{ site.rootURL }}/img/list/read-player-list-code-BYOB.jpg" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab05/Loops/ReadPlayerList.jpg"></div>

<br><br>

Once you get the script above to work, try to make a script that will read all of the player names and then say them all together, with the appropriate commas, spaces, and the word <tt>and</tt>, as shown below.  Remember to save your work!

<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img border="0" style="width: 434px; height: 233px;" title="Names all together" alt="Names all together" src="{{ site.rootURL }}/img/list/sprite-saying-all-names-in-list-BYOB.jpg" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab05/Loops/NamesAllTogether.jpg"></div>

<br><br><em>Hint</em>: Before you make the final result with the commas and <tt>and</tt>, try to make a script that just joins all the names into one variable, and then says that variable.   </body></html>
