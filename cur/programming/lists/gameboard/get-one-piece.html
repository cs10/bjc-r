Now that we have a game board, we want to be able to get and set the pieces in the game board.  Make the block below that takes an <code>x</code> value and a <code>y</code> value and a list.  It should report the character at that spot in the board.  For example, if we run the block with <code>x</code> = <code>4</code> and <code>y</code> = <code>3</code>, it should report the piece at the third row, fourth column (highlighted in black below).

<strong>Hints</strong>: <br><ul><li>You might want to (manually) change the piece that you want to extract to be a different letter (for example, <code>x</code>) so that you can see if you successfully got the correct element.</li>
<li>The following block will be helpful.  Play with it to understand how it works before you use it in the function above.</li>
