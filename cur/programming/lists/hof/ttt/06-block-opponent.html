<h3>Preliminary <code>ttt</code></h3>
<p>At this point you're ready to assemble a first version of the <code>ttt</code> block (you'll need to remove our current definition):
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/ttt-first.png" alt="ttt block with winning-square rule" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sample position we've been using all along has a winning move for O, but not for X:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/ttt-reports-1.png" alt="ttt wins for O" />
    <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/ttt-reports-fail.png" alt="ttt fails for X" />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Yes, we know that if the board has the same number of X squares as O squares it has to be X's turn. We'll worry about that when you write a complete game program. For now, it's easier to debug if we ignore that rule and use the same position regardless of who plays next, at least for this first rule.)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Question: Why do we get the answer 1 for O? What winning combination is the program finding?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Blocking The Opponent</h3>
<p>Now add a second rule to <code>ttt</code> that looks for a square in which the opponent can win on the next move. This new rule comes <em>after</em> the one we have already, because if the computer can win on this move, we don't care what the opponent could have done later.</p>
<p><strong>Big hint: Do not write any new helper blocks!</strong> You already have all the tools you need to find and block a potential win for the human player (can we use <code>winning square</code> with a different input to do this?).</p>
<div class="alert quoteGreen alert-success">
  <p>Implement the new opponent-blocking rule as described. Definitely use the hint to make it easier!</p>
</div>
<p>Once you've modified <code>ttt</code> with the new rule, it should give an answer for our sample board with the computer playing X, who can't win on this move but can block O's win on the next move:</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/ttt-reports-1-for-x.png" alt="ttt blocking for X" /></p>
<p>Congratulations-- at this point, you've built a tic-tac-toe agent that can see immediate wins, and block any of the opponent's immediate wins. What's next? You could choose to (1) pick a random spot in situations where there's no immediate win or opponent to block (2) prioritize the middle, then corners, then edges or (3) implement some more advanced tic-tac-toe strategies, if you're a tic-tac-toe buff and up for a challenge! (ever heard of 'forks'?)</p>
<div class="alert quoteGreen alert-success">
  <p>Complete your <code>ttt</code> block strategy so that it always makes a move.</p>
</div>
<h3>Nice Job!</h3>
<p>As we saw, stopping before we begin to ask ourselves questions about our program can really help out. We were more confident when writing blocks than we would've been because we knew what our goals were and were already thinking about how to implement them! Let's shift focus a bit for the rest of the lab- which should be helpful for upcoming project work (and doesn't involve writing too many blocks).</p>
