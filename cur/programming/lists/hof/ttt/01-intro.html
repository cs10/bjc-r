<title>Tic-Tac-Toe: Introduction</title>
</head>

<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p>We're not, right now, dealing with the user interface part of the game: displaying the board, accepting a move from the user, or even noticing when someone wins. Those parts have been done for you, but you could pretty easily add them yourself, too. Here is a <a class='run' href='/bjc-r/prog/algorithms/tic-tac-toe-framework-gui.xml'>starter file</a> for you to use. Try clicking the green flag to play the game. The computer is playing with a very unintelligent strategy for the moment, which you will improve upon in this lab.</p>
<p>The program will allow a human user to play against the computer. Your goal in this project is to write a block, <code>ttt</code>, that will determine the computer's next move based on the current position.</p>
<p>The  <code>ttt</code> block will  report the computer's next move given the current configuration. Here's what we'd like out of the block:
<ul>
  <li>Inputs: the current state of the game, and whether the computer is playing X or O.</li>
  <li>Output: where the computer should move.</li>
</ul>
<p>If those don't sound super defined (<em>current state</em>, <em>where to move</em>), don't worry- we'll define them on the next page together.</p>

  <div class="prompt">
     <p>
       Which question should we ask ourselves before we begin?
     </p>
  </div>

  <div class="choice" identifier="c1">
     <div class="text">How do you win tic-tac-toe?</div>
     <div class="feedback">
         We should definitely ask this question. Our <code>ttt</code> block should work toward satisfying the answer to this question. What else could we ask?
     </div>
  </div>
  <div class="choice" identifier="c2">
     <div class="text">What constitutes a good move?</div>
     <div class="feedback">
         This is definitely an important question; the <code>ttt</code> block's implementation will depend on the strategy we're going for. What other questions could we ask?
     </div>
  </div>
  <div class="choice" identifier="c3">
     <div class="text">What do I want my tic-tac-toe block to accomplish?</div>
     <div class="feedback">
         Yes, clearly defining the inputs and outputs of our <code>ttt</code> block is necessary before we begin writing anything. What else could we ask?
     </div>
  </div>
  <div class="choice" identifier="c4">
     <div class="text">All of the above are good questions you should ask.</div>
     <div class="feedback">
         Correct!
     </div>
