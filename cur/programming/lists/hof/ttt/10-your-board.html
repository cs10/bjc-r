<p>We just worked through one way to make a game involving a board. Now, let's make our own general purpose board in a different style.</p>
<div class="alert quoteRed">
	<!-- <p>We're going to be using a different <a class='run' href='http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=cs10sp16&ProjectName=General%20board%20game%20starter'>starter file</a> for the remainder of the lab.</p> -->
	<p>We're going to be using a different <a class='run' href='/bjc-r/prog/lists/board_game_starter.xml'>starter file</a> for the remainder of the lab.</p>
</div>
<p>One way to think of a board is as a collection of values at (row, column) coordinates. How can we represent this though when it comes to implementation? Lists store values, so let's start there.</p>
<p>Lists are groups of things in order, and we can group coordinates on a board into rows and columns:</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/board-rows-columns.png" alt="a board as rows and columns" /></p>
<p>Let's choose to think of our board as a group of rows. Notice that each row is a group of values.</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/board-item.png" alt="a board as a list of rows" /></p>
<p>It would make sense that each row be a list, right? The length of each list would then be the number of columns the board has. Since our board is made up of rows, it can be a list that stores all of the rows in it! Here's a visual representation of what this means:</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/board-snap-lists.png" alt="a list of rows in snap" /></p>
<p>In the lab file, we have already written a block called <code>create board of length ( )</code> that builds this structure for us. Check inside it to make sure we're all on the same page. For a board of size N, meaning a board with N rows and N columns, the block will generate a list with N items. Each item is a list of length N representing a row. Just like we planned!</p>
<p>Now that we have a board representation, we need to be able to work with it! Fill in <code>set () () of board</code> and <code>item () () of board</code> blocks so that they behave properly with our new style of board.</p>
<p>When you're done, congrats! You've just made your own board type.</p>

<p>How would our <code>set</code> and <code>get</code> blocks change if we decided to group coordinates by column instead?</p>
