        <p>
            Consider the following problem:
        </p>
        <div class="quoteBrown">
            <p>
                Write a predicate <code>increasing?</code> that takes a list of numbers as input, and outputs <code>true</code> if the numbers are in increasing order (equal neighbors are okay), or <code>false</code> otherwise.
            </p>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/hof/increasing-list-true-report.png" alt="increasing of (1 3 4 10) returning true">
            <br>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/hof/increasing-list-false-report.png" alt="increasing of (1 7 4 10) returning false">
        </div>

        <p>
            Because this is a predicate, it's tempting to try to make it use <code>keep</code>:
        </p>
        <img class= "indent" border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/wannabe-increasing.png"
        alt="report <empty? (keep items such that (<() < (???)>) from (list)"
        title="report <empty? (keep items such that (<() < (???)>) from (list)"/>

        <p>
            But <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code> work when each item in a list
            can be considered independently of the others.
            In this problem we have to
            consider each item <b>in relation to</b> the ones that have come before it:
            "<i>Is this number at least as big as the ones we've already seen?</i>"

        </p>
        <p>
            To do this, we need to write a loop.
            The loop needs to go through the lists items, from left to right, and keep track of the last item that
            it saw.
            But, as with <code>map</code>, we don't need to keep track of
            the specific number of where we are in the list (e.g., the third position, the first position, etc.)
            Those index numbers have nothing to do with the problem we're trying to solve.
            The solution is to use the <code>for each item</code> block, this way:
        </p>

        <img class="indent" border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/increasing.png" alt="definition of INCREASING? block" title="definition of INCREASING? block"/>
        <p>
            Like the functions used as input to <code>map</code> and friends,
            the script inside the C-shaped slot of <code>for each item</code>
            interprets empty input slots (in the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>set</code> blocks)
            as placeholders into which an item of the list will be entered.
            <code>For each item</code> promises to go through the list starting with item <code>1</code> and continuing in sequence to the end of the list. We use a script variable <code>minimum</code> to remember the most recent item's value, which is the
            minimum allowable value for the next item. If any item is smaller than that
            remembered value, <code>increasing?</code> reports <code>false</code>.
            If we make it to the end of the list without violating that requirement,
            then <code>increasing? </code>reports <code>true</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the <code>for each item</code> block has the word &quot;item&quot;
            in a round orange block. It's a variable, and you can drag it into the script
            that goes inside the C-slot, instead of using an empty input to
            represent the list item:
        </p>
        <img class="indent"  src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/increasing-item.png" alt="for each using item variable">


        
        <p>You can work with the above script <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/loop/increasing.xml">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>Try these</h2>

        <p class="step">
            <b>Try this: </b>
            Display a longish list using time instead of space on the screen
            by <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-fragment.png" alt="say">ing each item for two seconds.

        </p>
        <p class="step">
            <b>Try this: </b>Write an <code>expand</code> reporter that takes a sentence 
            as input, and reports a sentence that's the same except 
            that each number in the input is replaced by 
            that many copies of the following word:
