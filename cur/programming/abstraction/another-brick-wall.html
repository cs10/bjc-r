			Sometimes, when we write programs and scripts, it
			feels like we have hit a brick wall.  (This is a good
			sign; if a project isn't hard, you're not
			stretching your mind!)  Now, you are going
			to draw this brick wall:

		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="margin-left: 40px;"><img border="0" title="Sample image of brick wall" alt="Sample image of brick wall" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/wall.png" /></span>
		</p>
		<h2>Abstraction</h2>
		<p>
			While Snap<i>!</i> has lots of blocks for drawing and
			moving, it doesn't have anything about bricks. It
			wouldn't make sense to have one in general because
			most programs don't involve bricks. But ones that do
			could really use a <img
			src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-brick.png"
			alt="draw-brick" /> block. <img
			src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-brick.png"\/}
			alt="draw-brick" /> moves us away from having to talk
			in the computer's terms and closer to using the terms
			of the problem we're trying to solve. The process of
			moving from what the programming language gives you to
			a natural language (one that humans speak to
			communicate ) is critical to a
			good abstraction.

			In this problem, you will build an abstraction for drawing a brick wall, first by creating <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-brick.png" alt="draw-brick" />, then blocks for drawing rows, and ultimately the goal: <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-brick-wall-num.png" alt="draw-brick-wall-n" />.

<h2>Drawing One Brick</h2>

<p>A brick is a solid red rectangle ("brick red," i.e., not a bright
primary-color red but somewhat darker).  There's no "draw rectangle" block
in Snap<i>!</i>, but we can fake it by thinking of a rectangle as a very
thick line.  You know how to draw a line, with the <b>move</b> block.
In the <b>Pen</b> palette there's a <b>set pen size</b> block.  We can
use it to draw a thick line:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 40px;"><img border="0" title="code for brick" alt="Code for draw brick" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-brick-code.png" /></span>

<p>If you try out this block, you'll notice that your brick has rounded
ends.  These ends stick out beyond the length of the line you asked to
draw.  Here's a picture of the rounded brick with a regular line (pen size 1)
inside it:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 40px;"><img border="0" title="round brick" alt="Round brick" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/round-brick.png" /></span>

<p>These rounded ends are very pretty when drawing most pictures, but
they don't look like bricks, and they make thinking about lengths in
this project too complicated.  So for this project you're going to turn
off the rounded ends.  Click on the settings button
(<img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/settings.png"
alt="settings button">) in the toolbar, and turn on the "<b>Flat line
ends</b>" setting.

		<h2>Using Problem Decomposition to Write an Abstraction</h2>
		<p>
			Consider this line of code that was used to create the brick wall:
		</p>
		<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-brick-wall-7.png" alt="draw-brick-wall-7" />
		</p>
		<p>
If you were to ask a mason to make a brick wall with seven rows, he would
surely understand your meaning and make it happen. A computer, however,
doesn't know what that means, so you have to fill in the details. This means
going from the abstract (draw a brick wall) to the concrete (pardon the pun),
which involves problem decomposition.
		</p>
		<p>
			A quick observation shows that there are two kinds of rows of bricks:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Row A</strong>: <img class="inline" border="0" title="Row A" alt="Row A" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/row-a-flat.png" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Row B</strong>: <img class="inline" border="0" title="Row B" alt="Row B" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/row-b-flat.png" />
			</li>
		</ul>

<p>Make blocks <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/rowa-block.png"
alt="Row A"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/rowb-block.png"
alt="Row B">.  Think about what helper blocks besides <img
src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-brick.png" alt="Draw Brick"> you
might want.</p>

<p>It's possible to go overboard on abstraction, so that you have a gazillion
blocks and it's hard to find where the work actually gets done.  But, on the
other hand, sometimes it's useful to make a custom block even if its
definition is just one primitive block.  For example, to draw the
<i>mortar</i> (the white space) between blocks in a row, all you have to do
(since the <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-brick.png"
alt="Draw Brick"> block picks up the pen at the end of its script) is move
forward:</p>

<img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/move4.png" alt="Move 4 Steps">

<p>You could just use that <b>move</b> block inside your <b>Row A</b> block.
But you might instead want to define a <b>Draw Mortar</b> block.  Why?
Maybe later you'll decide that four steps is the wrong thickness for mortar,
and you'd rather have five steps.  If there are a dozen <b>Move</b> blocks
scattered through your program to draw mortar, you might not find them all.
With a <b>Draw Mortar</b> block, you can just change its definition, and
all the mortar in your picture will be changed.

<p>Notice that the two kinds of rows should be exactly the same length.  Your
first try at drawing a Row B will probably be a little too long.  Why?  Row A
has six whole bricks.  Row B has five whole bricks plus two half-bricks, which
adds up to six whole bricks.  To understand the bug, think about the amount of
<i>mortar</i> in each kind of row.</p>

<p>How are you going to fix it?  Should a Row B have different-size
bricks, different-size mortar gaps, or different-size half-bricks?
If you're not sure, try all the possibilities and see which looks right
in the finished wall.  (There's really only one good answer.)</p>

<p>Once you have the two kinds of rows the same length, you can write
the
<img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-brick-wall-num.png"
alt="Draw a Brick Wall with ( ) Rows">
block.  Remember that it should work for both even and odd numbers of
rows, which means that sometimes you'll have to draw an extra Row A.</p>

<p>(How do you know if a number is odd?  You'll find the
<img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/mod.png" alt="Mod">
block helpful.)</p>

<h2>Additional Exercises</h2>

<p>After you've drawn the picture at the top of this page, add more
inputs to the <b>Draw a Brick Wall</b> block:</p>

<ul><li>Length of the wall (how many bricks)</li>
<li>Length of a brick</li>
<li>Mortar thickness</li></ul>

<p>Add these one at a time, not all at once!  When you modify the
length of a brick, that should also change the length of a half-brick.
When you modify the mortar thickness, that should also change the
distance between rows (since that's mortar too).</p>
