			Sometimes, when we write programs and scripts, it feels like we have hit a brick wall. (This is a good sign - it is supposed to be hard!) Now, you are going to draw this brick wall:
		</p>
		<h2>Abstraction</h2>
		<p>
			<span style="margin-left: 40px;"><img border="0" title="Sample image of brick wall" alt="Sample image of brick wall" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/cat-wall.png" /></span>
		</p>
		<p>
			Consider the above picture. A person sees a cartoon cat and a brick wall. The computer sees 0s and 1s. It would be very difficult (and time-consuming!) for a person to write out all the 0s and 1s needed to tell the computer how to draw the brick wall. A programming language, such as Snap!, makes it easier to tell the computer what to do. It masks away all the details of the 0s and 1s through a process called abstraction.
		</p>
		<p>
			While Snap! has lots of blocks for drawing and moving, it doesn't have anything about bricks. It wouldn't make sense to have one in general because most programs don't involve bricks. But ones that do could really use a <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-brick.png" alt="draw-brick" /> block. <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-brick.png" alt="draw-brick" /> is English and moves us even further away from having to talk like a computer. The process of moving from what the programming language gives you to a natural language (one that humans speak to communicate--in this case, English) is critical to a good abstraction.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this problem, you will build an abstraction for drawing a brick wall, first by creating <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-brick.png" alt="draw-brick" />, then blocks for drawing rows, and ultimately the goal: <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-brick-wall-num.png" alt="draw-brick-wall-n" />.
		</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;
		</p>
		<h2>Using Problem Decomposition to Write an Abstraction</h2>
		<p>
			Consider this line of code that was used to create the brick wall:
		</p>
		<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-brick-wall-10.png" alt="draw-brick-10" />
		</p>
		<p>
			If you were to ask a mason to make a brick wall with ten rows, he would surely understand your meaning and make it happen. A computer, however, doesn't know what that means, so you have to fill in the details. This means going from the abstract (draw a brick wall) to the concrete (pardon the pun), which involves problem decomposition.
		</p>
		<p>
			A quick observation shows that there are two kinds of rows of bricks:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Row A</strong>: <img border="0" title="Row A" alt="Row A" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/row-a.png" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Row B</strong>: <img border="0" title="Row B" alt="Row B" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/row-b.png" />
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Drawing a brick wall involves some combination of the following:
		</p>
		<UL>
			<LI><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-row-a.png" alt="draw-row-a" />
			</li>
			<LI><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-row-b.png" alt="draw-row-b" />
			</li>
			<LI><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/init-sprite.png" alt="init-sprite" />
			</li>
			<LI><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/transition.png" alt="transition" /><li>
		</UL>
		<p>
			These, in turn, depend on:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y.png" alt="draw-row-b" />
			</li>
			<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/change-y.png" alt="init-sprite" />
			</li>
			<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/set-dir.png" alt="set-dir" />
			</li>
			<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/init-pen.png" alt="init-pen" />
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/init-pen.png" alt="init-pen" /> depends on:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-pen-size.png" alt="set-pen-size" />
			</li>
			<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-red.png" alt="init-pen" />
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			A row of bricks still needs to be broken into three pieces:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-long-brick.png" alt="draw-long-brick" />
			</li>
			<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-short-brick.png" alt="draw-short-brick" />
			</li>
			<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-mortar.png" alt="draw-mortar" />
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Here is a diagram that puts all of this together:
		</p>
		<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/abstraction-diagram-brick-wall-blocks.png" alt="abstraction" />
		</p>
		<p>
			At the highest level of abstraction is drawing a whole brick wall. It depends on the next highest level, which provides the capability of drawing the two row types as well as positioning of the sprite doing the drawing. These depend on the next lowest level, which is the drawing of individual bricks and mortar. At the bottom level are the Snap! primitive blocks (i.e., the blocks that come with Snap!, not the ones you write) and initializing the pen, which determines pen size and color.
		</p>

		<h2><strong>Exercises: Drawing the Brick Wall</strong> From the Bottom Up</h2>
		<p>
			Now you are going to build a brick wall by writing the blocks needed to complete the different levels of abstraction. If you would like to make the sprite a cat, that's fine, but it is not necessary to do this problem.
		</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;
		</p>
		<h3>Lowest Level of Abstraction</h3>
		<p>
			Write <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/init-pen.png" alt="init-pen" />, using <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-pen-size.png" alt="set-pen-size" /> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-red.png" alt="init-pen" />. (In the brick wall picture, the pen size is 10.)
		</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
		<h3>Third Level of Abstraction</h3>
		<p>
			(You will need to use <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pen-down.png" alt="pen-down" /> and/or <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pen-up.png" alt="pen-up" /> for these problems.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Write <strong><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-long-brick.png" alt="draw-long-brick" /></strong>. A long brick should be length 40. Make sure that <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/init-pen.png" alt="init-pen" /> is performed before testing <strong> <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-long-brick.png" alt="draw-long-brick" /></strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Write<strong> <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-short-brick.png" alt="draw-short-brick" /></strong>. A short brick should be length 12.
		</p>
		<p>
			Write <strong><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-mortar.png" alt="draw-mortar" /></strong>. Mortar should be length 16. Think carefully what it means to &quot;draw&quot; mortar!
		</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;
		</p>
		<h3>Second Level of Abstraction</h3>
		<p>
			Write <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-row-a.png" alt="draw-row-a" />, using <strong><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-long-brick.png" alt="draw-long-brick" /></strong> and <strong><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-mortar.png" alt="draw-mortar" /></strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Write <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-row-b.png" alt="draw-row-b" />, using <strong><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-long-brick.png" alt="draw-long-brick" /></strong>, <strong><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-short-brick.png" alt="draw-short-brick" /></strong>, and <strong><img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-mortar.png" alt="draw-mortar" /></strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Write <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/init-sprite.png" alt="init-sprite" />, using <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y.png" alt="draw-row-b" /> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/set-dir.png" alt="set-dir" />. In the brick wall picture, the cat sprite is starting at (-150, -120) with the cat facing towards the right.
		</p>
		<p>
			Write <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/transition.png" alt="transition" />, using <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/change-y.png" alt="init-sprite" /> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/set-dir.png" alt="set-dir" />. In the brick wall picture, y is being changed by 18 pixels.
		</p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<h3>First (Top) Level of Abstraction</h3>
		<p>
			Write <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-brick-wall-num.png" alt="draw-brick-wall-n" />, using <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-row-a.png" alt="draw-row-a" />, <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-row-b.png" alt="draw-row-b" />, <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/init-sprite.png" alt="init-sprite" />, and <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/transition.png" alt="transition" />.

		<h2><strong>Appendix: The Mathematics of Drawing the Brick Wall</strong></h2>
		<p>
			This is not intended to be a math class, but it is worth looking at the math for this problem. It might look like a short brick should be half the length of a long brick, but it's not! Let's see why.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let R be the total length of a row of bricks, L be the length of a Long brick, S be the length of a Short brick, and M be the amount of Mortar (represented in our pictures as space) between bricks. We get two equations:
		</p>
		<p>
			Row A equation: R = 6L + 5M
			<br />
			Row B equation: R = 5L + 6M + 2S
		</p>
		<p>
			Row A minus Row B: 0 = L - M - 2S or L = M + 2S
		</p>
		<p>
			Because we started two equations and more than two unknowns, we actually have an infinite number of possible ways to solve these equations! Which means that we have an infinite number of ways to draw a brick wall. However, we are constrained by the size of our display, which is 480x360. You can choose whatever L, M, and S values you like as long as your brick wall fits nicely into the display and L = M + 2S.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the pictures of bricks, L = 40, S = 12, and M = 16, but any combination of L, M, and S can work as long as L = M + 2S.
		</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;
		</p>
		<h3>For Hotshots:</h3>
		<p>
			Try different values of L, S, and M to verify that the equation L = M + 2S works for drawing brick walls.
