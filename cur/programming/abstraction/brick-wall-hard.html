            The picture below is a simple visualization of a brick wall that can be drawn using snap!

            In this activity you will be drawing this same brick wall.  Remember to use functional decomposition
            as much as you can so that your final <img class="inline" alt="brick wall block" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-brick-wall-num.png">
            block is easy to understand.  The following hints might be helpful:
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You can use a thick red pen to draw a single brick.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    There are two types of rows both composed of bricks.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Not all of the bricks are the same size.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
