        <p>
            You are going to work with a set of 500 real text
            messages, part of a collection recorded and collected by T.
            Almeida and J. Hidalgo (<a
            href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection">original
            source</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Two typical lines in our data look like this:

            <table id="tableBlue" width="80%">
                <tr>
                    <td>ham</td>
                    <td>Fair enough, anything going on?</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>spam</td>
                    <td>SMS. ac
                    Sptv: The New Jersey Devils and the Detroit Red Wings play Ice
                    Hockey. Correct or Incorrect? End? Reply END SPTV</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </p>

        <p>
            The raw data is <a href="spam-ham-500.txt">here</a>,
            but we've made a
            <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/data/spam-ham.xml">starter <span class="snap">snap</span> project</a>

            which you should open now.  It has a script that you can run
            to import the text data (from the above link), split it line by
            line and then into a list with two entries, and then store it into 
            a variable <code>datasheet</code>:</p>

            <p> 
             Be aware that this is real-world data with very casual
            langauge (we've already removed the messages with language that was
            <i>too</i> casual for a school assignment!)
        </p>
        <p class="quoteOrange">
            We will call that first word&mdash;spam or ham&mdash;
            the <i>ground truth classification</i>.  That is, at some point
            an actual human decided whether this message was spam or ham, and we'll consider
            this to be "the truth".  In this way, we can see how good our
            program is at classifying a message, based only on its contents,
             by comparing it this value.  
             You might actually disagree with some of the "truth" classifications
            that are in the file; if so, feel free to change them (and be ready to justify
            your belief to others!)
                 </p>
<p>Out of the 500 messages, how many are ham?  Write a script to find out.</p>
