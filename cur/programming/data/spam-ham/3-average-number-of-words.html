            The average number of words in a message

        <p>
            One approach to classifying messages is by separating them into
            individual words.  In this activity, you'll do this and then
            look at the average number
            of words in ham messages versus spam messages.  In the next activity,
            you'll write a classifier based on what you've learned.

        </p>

        <p>
            The following script might help you get started: it puts all the spam messages into
            a variable, and all the ham messages into another.

        alt="Making separate lists of spam and ham messages">

        <p>
            With those separate variables, you should be able to calculate the average
            number of words of each kind of message more easily.

            What's the <i>average</i> length of a spam message?  Of a ham message?
        </p>

            Because the math isn't <i>the</i> point of the exercise, here is a
            picture of a <a href="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/average.png" target="_blank"> <span class="snap">snap</span> block to calculate the average
