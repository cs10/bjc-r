            For the first part of this
            lab you are going to be in a similar situation as a forensic
            analyst who works for a law enforcement agency. In other
            words, you will be doing the work of a computer forensic
            specialist as you might have seen on any of the popular TV
            series like CSI, <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCIS_%28TV_series%29">NCIS</A>,
            or similar.

        <p>
            Here is your case, a kidnapping that has gone wrong:
        </p>
        <p class="quoteOrange">
            ...the criminal
            got away with the ransom even though the handover had been
            planned out very well by your colleagues. They thought it
            would have been a sure thing.  Angry and frustrated,
            your NCIS field colleagues come back to you with a set of
            GPS coordinates that have been included in the Twitter
            messages that the kidnapper used to communicate with them
            during "negotation". They want you to reconstruct the
            movements of the perpetrator.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are the coordinates:
