            Checking for Leap Years
        </title>

        <p>
            Some years in our (Gregorian) calendar are <b>leap years</b>. February has a 29th day and the year overall has 366.
            Many people think that leap years come every fourth year, and some know that this is because
            it takes the earth takes 365.25 days to revolve around the sun.
        <p></p>
        But, things are a bit more complicated than that: leap years come slightly less often than
        once every four years.  To figure out if a year (say, 1999) is a leap year, you need to
        test whether it is divisible evenly &mdash; that is, if there is no remainder after
        the division &mdash; by three different values.
        </p>
        <div class="quoteBrown">
            <p>A calendar year is a leap year if</p>
            <ul class="noborder">
                <li>
                    it can be divided evenly by <b>4</b>,
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>unless</i> it can also be divided evenly by <b>100</b>,
                </li>
                <li>
                    except if it is also divisible evenly by <b>400</b>, in which case it is a leap year.
                </li>
            </ul>
           <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#Gregorian_calendar">We aren't making this up.</a> </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Thus 2000 was a leap year (divisible evenly by 400, 100, and 4), 
            1900 was not (divisible evenly by 100 and 4 but not by 400), 
            1996 was (divisible evenly by 4 but neither 100 nor 400), and 1999
            wasn't (not divisible by anything!) .
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the block sets below: they all say <b>"leap year"</b>
            if the <code>year</code> variable is a leap year and <b>"normal year"</b> otherwise.  That is, they all
            work correctly, without any bugs.
