     <p>
       <b>Reminder that you can work on 2048 in pairs.</b> Your partner (if any)
       that you work with in lab today does not necessarily need to be the same partner that you work with on 2048 throughout the next week and a half.

       <br>
       <p>
         Before beginning this lab, read over the <a href="http://cs10.org/sp16/assign.html?//docs.google.com/document/d/1z-DZD3ya3Uxp9WkkmqF838Giq_VEjtdmXNI0dVzU5sg/pub">spec for 2048</a> up until you get to <b>"The Assignment"</b>. Stop there.
