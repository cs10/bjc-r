         Now that you've read over the basics of the assignment, let's refine our understanding. Begin this lab by opening up the starter file linked on the assignment spec. You should see:
           <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2048-testing/main_sprite_code.png" alt="lists of nouns, verbs, etc." title="lists of nouns, verbs, etc." /></p>

        <p>Click on the "Game Code" Sprite, and you should see a ton of code. <b>For this HW, you should NOT change any existing code in this sprite (otherwise you might break the game), </b> unless you are doing some of the extra credit options.

        <p>Without changing any existing code, add a script to the scripting area of the Game Code sprite with the following code (the "update display for" block is under Looks). Run it, and you should see a 2 appear gloriously in the top right corner.  What this code does is it first creates a new empty gameboard of size 4x4, then it places a 2 at position (1,4) in the gameboard (this corresponds to the top right corner), and lastly it updates the display of the screen so that a picture of a 2 actually appears.
        </p>
           <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2048-testing/simple_board_setup_script.png" alt="lists of nouns, verbs, etc." title="lists of nouns, verbs, etc." /></p>

           <div class="alert quoteGreen alert-success">
             <h4><strong>For You To Do:</strong></h4>
             <p>
               Modify the script above so that it displays the board pictured below. This is an opportunity for you to use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/2048-testing/set_item.png" /> block and learn how the grid works for the 2048 game. <b>Note:</b> if you want the images to appear you will need to use the update display block after setting the appropriate values in the board (as is shown above).
             </p>
             <img src="/bjc-r/img/2048-testing/example_board.png" alt="this should be a board" style="width: 10em"/>
