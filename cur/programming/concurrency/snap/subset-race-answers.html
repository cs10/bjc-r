<p>Play around with the script first: <code><a href="../../../../prog/Snap/SubsetRace.xml" target="_blank" download>Race</a></code>.</p>


<p>The answer is: all the permutations of a,b,c where all three letters
are present (there are six of them) + all the permutations of a,b,c
where only two letters are present (also six of these) + all the
permutations of a,b,c where only one letter is present (three
possibilities) for a total of fifteen possibilities.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If all three letters are present, it is as if we were deterministic (didn't have random wait times).
      Here is how it could happen (for this example order, all 6 permutations
      are possible = {abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, bca}):
      <ul>
        <li>result starts empty</li>
        <li>a, b, and c all clear result.</li>
				<li>a reads result (), joins its a, result is now a.</li>
        <li>b reads result (a), joins its b, result is now ab.</li>
        <li>c reads result (ab), joins its c, result is now abc.</li>
        <li>finish is abc</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If
only two letters were present, we had a race condition, and here is how
it could happen (again, all 6 combinations and permutations are
possible = {ab, ba, ac, ca, bc, cb}): <ul>
        <li>result starts empty</li>
        <li>a clears result ()</li>
        <li>a reads result (), joins its a, result is now a.</li>
        <li>b and c clear result.</li>
        <li>b reads result (), joins its b, result is now b.</li>
				<li>c reads result (b), joins its c, result is now bc.</li>
        <li>finish is bc</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If
only one number were present, we also had a race condition, and here is
how it could happen (again, all permutations possible = {a, b, c}): <ul>
        <li>result starts empty</li>
        <li>a, b clear result.</li>
				<li>a reads result (), joins its a, result is now a.</li>
        <li>b reads result (a), joins its b, result is now b.</li>
        <li>c clears result.</li>
				<li>c reads result (), joins its c, result is now c.</li>
        <li>finish is c</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
  </ul>
