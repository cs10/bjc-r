<p> In the last Snap! exercise, it was a little artificial; the
sprites were in lock step. Let's take a look at a similar project, <code>
<a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/Snap/Determinism.xml">Determinism</a></code>. Here,
four 60x60 sprites do the same thing (color the screen by stamping
themselves through the <code>Fill Screen</code> command shown below),
and once they finish, they add their name to the end of the <code>finish</code>
variable. Run it a couple of times. Boring, right? That was because
Snap! is still in lock step. </p>

<p> Make a very small change to Fill Screen - have each sprite wait a
random value between 1 and 1/10 seconds before stamping. (this involves
the introduction of a very simple command right before the "stamp" call
in <code>Fill Screen</code>: "wait (1 / (pick random [1] to [10]))
secs"). Run it a few times; now what happens? (Answer: Four "threads"
take off, and the slowest (i.e., last) color at each time step is that
one who colors that 60x60 square). Save this project as a Snap! file
called <code>NonDeterminism.xml</code>.
