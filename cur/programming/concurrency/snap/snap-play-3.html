<p> Let's explore some subtle details. </p>

<ul>

  <li>&nbsp; Open this Snap! file <code><a class="run" href="../../../../prog/Snap/MultipleBroadcast.xml">MultipleBroadcast</a></code>,
shown above.
    <ul>
      <li> Take a look at the green flag hat block and the "<code>when
I receive <em>go</em></code>" hat block Do you agree that all 5
numbers in <code>nums</code> should always be the same when the
program is done running? This is called a <em>Loop Invariant</em>
(something that if it is true before the loop, will be true after the
loop), and it is easy to prove this should always be the case. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Make sure you have "<code>Edit-&gt;Thread Safe Scripts</code>"
checked in the Snap! menu. </li>
  <li> Hit the <code>r</code> key (for <strong>r</strong>eset), space
bar (to broadcast <code>go</code> once), <code>w</code> key (to send
three consecutive broadcast-and-waits of <code>go</code>), and <code>
b </code> key (to send three consecutive broadcasts of <code> go</code>).
Are all the values the same? Did you get what you expect? (No, the
broadcasts should have incremented each number 3 times but it only
incremented it once!) </li>
  <li> Now uncheck <code>Edit-&gt;Thread Safe Scripts</code>, and reset
the values of all 5 elements to 0. </li>
  <li> Now reset, and try the <code> space</code>, <code> w</code>,<code>
    </code> and <code> b </code> keys. What just happened? Did you
get what you expect? (No, the broadcasts should have incremented each
number 3 times, but it only incremented the first one!) </li>
</ul>
