            In this course, you will use a technique that professional programmers call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming" target="_blank">pair programming</a>&mdash;writing computer programs in teams of two people. One partner (the "driver")  controls the computer, writing the program; the other parnter (the "navigator") observes and helps plan and catch errors.

            It is important  to <em>switch roles frequently</em> and be sure to get equal time working in both roles. This ensures that each partner has a good understanding of all parts of the program, and that the person in each role remains focused. As you progress through labs, we will suggest places for you and your partner to switch roles. </p>

        <div>
             Now is a good time to switch roles! If you've been the <em>navigator</em>, switch and become the <em>driver</em>.
