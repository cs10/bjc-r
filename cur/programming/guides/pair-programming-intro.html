	<h1>Introduction to Pair Programming</h1>
	<p>
	    In this course, we will be using a technique called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming"
	    target="_blank">pair programming</a>. Pair programming is the practice of writing computer programs in
	    pairs, with one partner (the "driver") actively controlling the computer and the other (the "navigator")
	    observing. As the driver writes the program, the observer helps plan and catch errors.
	</p>
	<p>
	    An important feature of pair programming is that the partners switch roles frequently. This ensures that
	    each partner has a good understanding of all parts of the program, and that the person in each role remains
	    focused. As you progress through labs, we will suggest places for you and your partner to switch roles.

         If you've been the <em>navigator</em>, now would be a good time to
         become the <em>driver</em>. Each partner should make sure to get equal
         time working with both roles.
