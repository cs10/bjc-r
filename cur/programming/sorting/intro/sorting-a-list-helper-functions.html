Now, we will tackle the problem of <em>sorting</em> a list: we have a list of numbers or letters, and we want to arrange them in a particular order.  Well, that sounds very complicated, but we can make good use of our function that checks if a list is in order. A common technique when writing programs is to think: <br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">"wow this would be simple if I just had a function that did _____"<br></div><br>We have such a case here! Below we've written a sort function that uses swapping. If we just had a function (that we're calling "swap out of order elements in list") that went through the list once and uses the swap block to swap every out of order element, we could just keep doing that until the list was completely sorted. <br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/sort-list-code-with-helpers-BYOB.gif" alt="Block to sort a list." title="Block to sort a list." ><br><br></div>

What we did is make a "stub" (an unimplemented block that just has the right name and arguments) for this new block and then we used it in our sort function. If we convince ourselves that this would work, we can go on to think about how to write the swap function. <br><br>To try to break problems down, always look for times when you could say: <br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">"wow this would be simple if I just had a function that did _____"<br></div> <br><ol><li>Pretend you have that function (even if you're not sure yet how to write it) and make a "stub" of that function.</li>
  <li>Write your higher level function using the stub. (You won't be able to test this until you actually figure out how to write the stub.)</li>
  <li>Go to the stub and try to figure out how to write it (hopefully you have another insight of 2 or 3 other functions that if you had them, it would be simple to write the original stub.</li>
</ol>Now work with your partner to write the "swap out of order elements in list" function and test it before returning and testing it with your swap function. <br>    </div>
