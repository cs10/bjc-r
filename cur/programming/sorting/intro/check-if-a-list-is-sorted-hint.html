You should be reading this if you either got stuck on the exercise in the last section, or if you have finished the exercise.  Either way, we still think it would be good to read.

Here are some things to think about:
<ul><li>We want this to return either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.  Such blocks are <strong>predicate</strong> blocks, so we need to select the predicate reporter block shape when we make the block.</li>
<li>A list is in order if every sequential pair is in the correct order.</li>
<li>We can assume that the list is in order until we find evidence that it is not.</li>
<li>We are going to need an index variable to step through each pair of elements in the array.</li>
<li>It is helpful to create variables (and give names to particular useful information) to keep track of things.  For example, in the image below, we chose to make variables <code>current</code> and <code>next</code> to keep track of the current list element and the next list element, respectively, when we are in the loop that moves through the list.
