   target="_blank">this drawing program</a> for a little bit. Press
   the spacebar to run the program, and move your mouse cursor over
   the stage of the Snap<i>!</i> window. While over the stage, use the
   <b>d</b> (pen down), <b>u</b> (pen up), and <b>c</b> (clear) keyboard keys to change what gets drawn on the screen. The script that causes the sprite to follow the pointer is
        </p>
        <p>
        	<img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_kaleidoscopescript.png" alt="Kaleidoscope Script"/>
        </p>
        <p>
        	As you can see, this drawing program features more
   <b>Control</b> blocks, in addition to the <b>forever</b> block
   first introduced in the Follow the Mouse activity. These
   <em>hat</em> shaped blocks, which can be used only at the beginning
   of a script, indicate when a specific script should be run.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The script in the image above just makes the sprite follow the mouse. The <img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_gotoxy.png" alt="Go to X Y Block"/> block moves the sprite directly to a position on the stage, as you might have guessed. The <img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_mousex.png" alt="Mouse X Sensor Block"/> and <img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_mousey.png" alt="Mouse Y Sensor Block"/> reporters are found in the <b>Sensing</b> tab group, and report the current x and y position of the mouse pointer.
        </p>
<p><b>Try this:</b> change the <b>go to</b> block to look like this:</p>
        <p>
        	<img src="../../../../img/topic1/xplus30.png" alt="Go
   To X+30 Script"/>
        </p>
        <p>How does this change the program's behavior?</p>
        <p>
        	For this activity, your job is to make a (kind of) kaleidoscope, like:
        </p>

        </p>

        	Tips and Tricks:
        	<ol>
        		<li>
        			You will need four sprites.  (We
   haven't used more than one sprite up to now, but having more than
   one allows for more interesting projects, as you'll see.) The
   easiest way to create three more is to <em>duplicate</em> the one
   you have. Right-click the sprite in the sprite corral, and select
   <b>duplicate</b> from the <em>context menu</em> that appears. Each
   duplicated sprite will have exactly the same scripts as the
   original, which is why we suggest duplication rather than just
   creating more sprites from scratch.
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			You can change the color of each sprite by clicking the color input in that sprite's <img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_setpentocolorx.png" alt="Set Pen to Color X Block"/> block (found under the <b>Pen</b> tab), choosing a color, and then clicking on the the block itself (to run the block and actually set the color). Don't worry about matching the colors in the animation exactly!
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			Pay close attention to what each of
   the other sprites is doing in the animation above. You will need to
   modify the <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> inputs in each sprite's <img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_gotoxy.png" alt="Go to X Y Block"/> block using simple formulas.
        		</li>
        			<ol>
        				<li>
        					For instance, the <img
   src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_plusmousex.png" alt="7 +
   MouseX" /> block will report a number that is 7 larger than <img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_mousex.png" alt="Mouse X Sensor Block"/> alone. You will find the <img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_mousex.png" alt="Mouse X Sensor Block"/> and <img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_mousey.png" alt="Mouse Y Sensor Block"/> blocks under the <b>Sensing</b> tab. You will find the math blocks such as <img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_subtract.png" alt="Subtraction Block"/> under the <b>Operators</b> tab. We will explore the other blocks under the <b>Operators</b> tab in future labs.
        				</li>
        				<li>
        					Hint: All the sprites are reflecting in different ways around the (x=0, y=0) origin point of the stage.
        				</li>
        			</ol>
        	</ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        	Once you figured this out, try out some complicated formulas and/or more sprites, and share with your classmates!
