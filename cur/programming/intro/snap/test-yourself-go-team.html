                    Without trying this in <span class="snap">snap</span>, try to answer the following question:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    What does the following set of scripts do when the <code>Turn1</code> message is broadcast?

            <div class="choice" identifier="c1">
                <div class="text">
                    The sprite says &quot;Go!&quot; and then &quot;Team!&quot; and then stops.

                    No, the <code>broadcast Turn1 and wait</code> block after the <code>say Team! ...</code> block will execute.  Snap! will blindly follow its script.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="choice" identifier="c2">
                <div class="text">
                    The sprite repeatedly says &quot;Go!&quot; and then &quot;Team!&quot; until you hit the red Stop button.
                </div>
                <div class="feedback">
                    <p>
                        Right!
                        Here, we see an <em>infinite loop,</em> or a never-ending loop. 
                        Whenever this happens in Snap<em>!</em>, we can always stop it by 
                        pressing the Stop button at the top right of the window, just above the stage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why does this happen? Well, when you the <code>Turn1</code> message is first broadcast,
                        the sprite says <code> Go!</code>
                        for half a second, and then broadcasts a <code>Turn2</code> message.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If there is any character that has a script that responds to the <code>Turn2</code>
                        message, it will perform that script. 
                        In this case, the same sprite has a script that responds to the <code>Turn2</code>
                        message, and so it will run the corresponding script. It says <code>Team!</code>
                        and then broadcasts a <code>Turn1</code>
                        message. But, it also has a script that responds to the <code>Turn1</code>
                        message, which in turn sends a <code>Turn2</code>
                        message, and so on. This continues until the scripts are forced to stop.

                <div class="text">
                    Nothing happens - the script does not work.
                </div>
                <div class="feedback">
                    No, the script here definitely does something when receiving the <code>Turn1</code> script.

                    The sprite says &quot;Go!&quot; and then &quot;Team!&quot;, repeating a few times, and then stops by itself.
                </div>
                <div class="feedback">
                    No.  The computer can't just decide to stop itself; rather, it will blindly follow the script.
