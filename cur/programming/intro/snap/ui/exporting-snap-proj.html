   			Congratulations! You have finished the very first lab of this course! To save your work, you have two options. We suggest either option 1 or option 2A to save your project.
   		</p>
   		<p>
   			<strong>1. Exporting Your Snap<em>!</em> Project to Your Computer</strong>
   		</p>
   		<p>
   			The point of exporting your project is so that you have a physical copy of it that you can keep on your desktop.
   		</p>
   		<p>
   			<ol>
   				<li>
   					Click on the file icon button on the upper left corner of the Snap<em>!</em> window.
   					<img - INSERT IMAGE>
   				</li>
   				<li>
   					Select "Export Project."
   				</li>
   				<li>
   					A new tab will open and you should see something that looks like this:
   					<img - INSERT IMAGE>
   				</li>
   				<li>
   					Right click anywhere in the browser window, and select the Save As option.
   				</li>
   				<li>
   					Name the file however you want. The file you are exporting will be in an .xml file format.
   				</li>
   				<li>
   					Now save to your desktop or wherever you want on your computer.
   				</li>
   			</ol>
