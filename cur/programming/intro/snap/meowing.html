            Now that you feel comfortable using the Snap! user interface, you can begin to examine how sprites and blocks interact with one another. 
            Click <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/bjc-intro.xml" title="BJC intro project" target="new">this link</a> to open the attached Snap<em>!</em> project in a new tab.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>play sound</code> blocks from earlier allow us to control when and how many sounds we hear.
        <p>
            If you run this script (which should already appear in the first sprite's scripting area):
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/three-plays.png" >
            <br>
            <br>
            how many finger snaps do you you hear?
        </p>
        <p>
            How about this one:
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/three-play-dones.png" >
            <br>
            <br>
            How many snaps do you you hear now?
            <br>
            <br>
            Experiment with these blocks:
            <br>
            1) How about two <code>play sound [snap] </code>and then one <code>play sound [snap] until done</code>?
            <br>
            <img border="0" title="meow-meow-meow until done" alt="meow-meow-meow until done" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/playplaydone.png" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/meow-3.jpg">
            <br>
        </p>
        <table width="201undefined">
            <tbody></tbody>
        </table>
        2) How about two <code>play sound [snap] until done</code> and then one <code>play sound [snap]</code>?
        <br>
        <br>
        <em></em><img border="0" title="meow until done twice and meow" alt="meow until done twice and meow" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/donedoneplay.png" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/meow-4.jpg">
