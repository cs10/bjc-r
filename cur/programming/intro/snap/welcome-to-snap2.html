        <p>
            <span class="snap">snap</span> is a programming language, which you can use
            to tell a computer what to do.
            A <i>program</i> is a particular set of instructions for the computer
            to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Programs in most languages use only letters (and punctutation), but
            <span class="snap">snap</span> is different: it's a visual language.
            Instead of writing a program only using the keyboard,
            you will drag pictures of blocks and click them together.

            <br>
            <br>

            Can you guess what it might do?

        <p>
            <span class="snap">snap</span> is different that many other languages in
            another way&mdash; you run it in a web browser like Firefox or Chrome.
            At this time, we recommend you use the
            <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome browser</a>.
            The url that you can use to always get to <em>Snap!</em> is:
        </p>

        <p class="center " style="font-size:150%;line-height: 150%">
        
            <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/run" target="_blank"><b>http://snap.berkeley.edu/run</b></a>

        </p>

        <p>
            In order to save your programs, the first thing you'll need to do is make an
            account.  In the <span class="snap">snap</span> browser window,
            Find the cloud-shaped button in the top toolbar on the upper
            left corner of the window:</p>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-cloud-with-context.png"
            alt="cloud icon"/>.


        <p>
            Click it, select
            the "sign up" option in the menu, and follow the instructions
            there. You will need to check your email after creating your
            account to get your initial password.
