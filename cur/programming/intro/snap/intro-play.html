        <p>
            The <code>play sound </code> blocks in the short script examples from the last page played in order: one block and then the next until there are no more blocks to run. But we did see that what we actually heard depended on whether we waited until one sound was done playing before starting the next or not.  (So what use is the non-<code>until done</code> version of the<code> play sound </code>block? If different sprites play different sounds at once, you can hear them both overlapping.)<code>
                <br>
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>broadcast</code> block allows us to control which block is run next. Try to make these scripts in <span class="snap">snap</span>.

                You can make a new project by clicking on <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-file-menu.png" alt="Snap file menu button"> in the <span class="snap">snap</span> tool bar, at the top of the window.
            </li>
            <li>
                You'll need to add a sprite to your project: use <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-new-sprite.png" alt="Snap new sprite button">
                between the stage and the sprite corral, at the center right of the window.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each sprite will have separate costumes and scripting areas: click on the image in the sprite corral to
                focus on it.  To add costumes, you just need to drag an image from a page in your browser
                over to the scripting area of your snap window.  Here are costumes you can use:

                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/costumes/alonzo.gif" alt="Alonzo sprite costume">
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/costumes/duck1.png" alt="Duck sprite costume">
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Each sprite will have different scripts.  To switch between the scripts and costumes for a sprite, use the
                tabs at the top of the scripting area.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once you are done, press <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-green-flag.png" alt="Snap green flag button"> to start the short play.
            </li>
        </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                A note about style: You will notice that we chose to name the messages that were broadcast so that it would help us keep track of what we were doing and what messages we were sending. We recommend that you do this in your projects!

            <h2>Hint</h2>
            <p>
                Try to figure out what motion blocks and buttons below do. 
                Can you get the characters to face each other?
