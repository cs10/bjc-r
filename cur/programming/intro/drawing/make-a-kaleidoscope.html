            Explore <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/drawing/kaleidoscope.xml">this drawing program</a> for a little bit.
            Press the space bar and move the mouse&mdash;the single sprite is a little laggy, but serviceable.  
            Use the <code>d</code> (down), <code>u</code> (up), and <code>c</code> (clear) keys to change what gets drawn on the screen.
            The script that causes the sprite to follow the pointer is:

        </p>
        <img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/drawing/follow-mouse-when-space-bar-pressed.png" src="script to make sprite follow the mouse when the space bar is pressed" />
        <p>
            The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y.png" alt="go to x y block"> 
            block moves the sprite directly to a position on the
            stage, as you might have guessed.
            The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-x.png" alt="mouse x block"> and 
            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-y.png" alt="mouse y block">
            blocks are found in the "sensing" tab group, and report the current <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> position of the mouse pointer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your job is to make a (kind of) kaleidoscope, like:
        </p>
        <img style="border:thick solid black" class= "center" src="/bjc-r/img/drawing/kaleidoscope.gif" alt="animation of a sort of a kaleidoscope" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                You'll need four sprites: the easiest way to create them is to duplicate the one you have.  "Right-click" the
                sprite and select <code>duplicate</code> from the context menu.  Each duplicated sprite will have exactly the
                same scripts as the original.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can change the color of each sprite by clicking the color input in that sprite's 
                <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-red.png" alt="set pen color block"/> block, 
                choosing a color, and then clicking on the the block itself
                (to run the block and actually set the color). Don't worry about matching the colors in the
                animation exactly!
            </li>
            <li>
                Pay close attention to what each of the other sprites is doing in the animation above.  You'll need
                to modify the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> in each sprite's 
                <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y.png" alt="go to x y block"> block
                using a simple formulas.  
                <div  style="text-indent:20px">
                For instance,  
                <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/plus-7-mouse-x.png" alt="add 7 to mouse x">
                will return a number that is <code>7</code> larger than 
                <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-x.png" alt="mouse x block"> 
                alone.
                You'll find the 
                <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-x.png" alt="mouse x block"> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-y.png" alt="mouse y block">
                blocks in the "Sensing" tab group, and math blocks (such as 
                  <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/minus.png" alt="minus">) in the "Operators" tab group.
                </div>
                  
                <div class="quoteBrown">Hint: all the sprites are
                reflecting, in different ways, around the <code>(x=0, y=0)</code> stage center point.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>Once you figured it out, try out some <i>complicated</i> forumlas and/or more sprites, 
                and share with your classmates!</li>
