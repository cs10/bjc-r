      We want one of the characters to react if the two characters touch.  In the last step, we showed an example with <code>Cat</code> and <code>Mouse</code>.  We can add either of the following equivalent scripts to the <code>Mouse</code> sprite to say <code>OH NOs!!!</code> when it touches the cat. <br><br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" title="Mouse script when touching cat" alt="Mouse script when touching cat" src="/bjc-r/img/conc/touching-cat-forever-with-oh-nos-script-BYOB.jpg" ><br></div>
      <br><em>Note</em>: One really important thing to note here is that once we click the green flag, the scripts above will <strong>always</strong> be running: notice that they always have a highlighted outline.  Compare this to the script below that would only run once when you click the green flag.  The functionality above is often called an <strong>infinite loop</strong>, and can be very helpful when we want something to continue running forever.
