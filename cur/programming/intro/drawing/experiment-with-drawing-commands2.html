        	Try to get comfortable with the blocks under the
   <b>Motion</b> tab and the <b>Pen</b> tab. Figure out what each one does, and try to use these blocks to draw a square or a simple picture. Get started by testing these blocks:
        </p>
        <p>
        	<img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_move10steps.png" alt="Move 10 Steps Block"/>
        </p>
        <p>
        	<img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_turnrightxdegs.png" alt="Turn Right 15 Degrees Block"/>
        </p>
        <p>
        	<img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_clear.png" alt="Clear Block"/>
        </p>
        <p>
        	<img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_pendown.png" alt="Pen Down Block"/>
        </p>
        <p>
        	<img src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_penup.png" alt="Pen Up Block"/>
        </p>
        <p>
        	Tips and Tricks:
        	<ol>
        		<li>
        			Once the pen is down, it stays down
   even in a different script. Use the â€œpen upâ€� block to lift the pen
   so that no lines will be drawn.
        		</li>
     
        		<li>
        			You also will want to show the direction and x and y position of the sprite. In the Motion tab, you can select for these to be shown on the stage as described in the <a href="/bjc=r/cur/programming/intro/topic1_intro/sprites-sensor-blocks.html"> Reporters</a> activity you saw earlier in the lab.
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			Try this: Does the <b>turn</b> block change the x or the y position?
        		</li>
        	</ol>
