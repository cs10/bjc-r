	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's play a number-guessing game (you have already seen this <a href="bjc-r/cur/programming/conditionals/number-guessing-game-v2-0.html">in lab 3</a>). &nbsp;<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between your partner and yourself, decide who
will be person G, the guesser: the other person (person P, for picker)
picks a number between 1 and 50.&nbsp; Person G asks person P questions
to determine the chosen number; the only answers that person P can give
are "yes" or "no".&nbsp; The guesser should try two different
strategies to playing this game: <br><ol><li>Guessing in sequence: "Is the number 1?", "Is the number 2?", "Is the number 3?", and so on.<br><br></li>
		<li>Guessing
halfway:&nbsp; You know the number must be between 1 and 50, so you
start off by asking "Is the number greater than 25?".&nbsp; If the
answer is "yes", you instantly know that it must be between 26 and 100,
so you ask "Is the number greater than 50?"; otherwise, the number must
be between 1 and 25, so you ask "Is the number greater than 12?"&nbsp;
Keep asking questions involving the halfway point.</li>
	</ol>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play several (around 3) games: person P should
pick a wide variety of numbers, while person G should use each strategy
alternately.&nbsp; As you play each game, think about which strategy
involves fewer questions.&nbsp; Which strategy would be better if, say,
the guessing game involved numbers from 1 to 1000?&nbsp; From 1 to a
million?&nbsp; Discuss why one strategy better than the other? </body></html>
