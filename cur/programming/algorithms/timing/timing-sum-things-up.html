		<p>
			We will now see an example where the runtime of an algorithm really does make a difference. 
			Remember the game you played with young Gauss at the beginning of lab? 
			We will implement the game in Snap!.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/loops/sum-things-up.html">Earlier in the lab</a>, 
			you made a block that returned the sum of numbers between <code>1</code> and <code>max</code>. 
			In the <code>Variables</code> menu, you will see two blocks:
		</p>
		<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
			<img style="width: 241px; height: 61px;" alt="add all numbers in list" src="../../../../img/list/add-numbers-to-list-blocks.png" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab08/Complexity/AddBlocks.gif">
		</div>
		<p>
			The first block sums up the numbers in the <code>numbers</code> list the normal, "non-Gauss" way: 
			walking through the list and adding the numbers one by one. 
			The second block sums up the numbers the "Gauss" way: using the formula <code>(N + 1) * N/2</code>, where, 
			in this case, <code>N</code> is the same as <code>max</code>. 
			(<a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/algorithms/competing-with-young-gauss.html">How did we get this formula?</a>) 
			Complete the bodies of these blocks.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you are done, drag the first block (the "non-Gauss" block) onto the stage and place it immediately after the 
			<code>add all numbers between 1 and max</code> block. Also, move the <code>reset timer</code> block <em>after</em> 
			the <code>add all numbers between 1 and max</code> block, since we only need to time how long the "non-Gauss" 
			block takes to sum the numbers in the <code>numbers</code> list.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, run the script with <code>max</code> set to <code>10</code>. Again, run it a few times to 
			get an idea of the average time the computer takes to sum the numbers up. 
			Repeat the experiment with <code>max</code> set to <code>20</code>, <code>40</code>, 
			<code>100</code>, and <code>1000</code>. Based on your observations, what kind of 
			runtime does the "non-Gauss" block have: constant, 
			linear, or neither? Why do you think this is the case?
		</p>
		<p>
			Replace the "non-Gauss" block with the "Gauss" block. 
			Once more, run the script with <code>max</code> set to <code>10</code>. 
			Again, run it a few times to get an idea of the average time the 
			computer takes to sum the numbers up. Repeat the experiment with 
			<code>max</code> set to <code>20</code>, <code>40</code>, <code>100</code>, and <code>1000</code>. 
			Based on your observations, what kind of runtime does the 
			"Gauss" block have: constant, linear, or neither? 
			Why do you think this is the case?
