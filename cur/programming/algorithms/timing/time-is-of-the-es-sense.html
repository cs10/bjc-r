<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen how Snap! can be used to wait
for a certain time before reporting anything. Snap! also allows us to
do the converse: to report how long a program takes to finish. In the <code>Sensing</code> menu, you will see a command called <code>reset timer</code> and a reporter called <code>timer</code>: <br><br></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activate (tick-mark) the <code>timer</code>
reporter and you should see a timer ticking away in the top left
corner.&nbsp; It's been ticking ever since you opened up Snap!, and
counts in tenths of a second:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to be performing timing
experiments in the following sections, so this timer will prove
useful.&nbsp; Add the following timing framework script into the space
for Snap! scripts:<br>
<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<img style="width: 148px; height: 103px;" src="../../../../img/lab-8/timing-framework.png" alt="Timing Framework" title="Timing Framework" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab08/Complexity/TimingFramework.jpg"></div>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The script will reset the timer whenever the green flag is pressed. The sprite will then say <code>Hello!</code> for 1 second, and soon after that, the sprite will say the current time, less 1 second to account for how long the sprite said <code>Hello!</code>.&nbsp; If we replace <code>Hello!</code>
with a reporter, then the sprite will say the answer of the reporter,
and one second later, how long the reporter took to generate the
answer: this is the timing information that we need.&nbsp; Save the
script with the name <code>TimingFramework</code>.   </body></html>
