            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this section, we will be using <a href="../../../../prog/algorithms/timing-framework.xml">this timing framework</a>.&nbsp;
It is very similar to the framework you constructed earlier, but it
also has the stubs for a few blocks that we will be filling in.&nbsp;
The first block that we will fill in is already on stage: </p>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 294px; height: 42px;" title="Insert all numbers between 'start' and 'end' into 'list'" alt="Insert all numbers between 'start' and 'end' into 'list'" src="../../../../img/list/insert-all-numbers-block.png" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab08/Complexity/InsertAllNumbers.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This block should fill the input list with all of the numbers from <tt>start</tt> to <tt>end</tt>.&nbsp; If working correctly, the version used on stage should generate all of the numbers from <tt>1</tt> to <tt>max</tt>, where <tt>max</tt> is a number that we will change when running timing experiments, and should add them to the <tt>numbers</tt> list.
        </p>
        <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, talk to your partner and discuss an
algorithm that you can use to fill the input list with all of the
numbers from <tt>start</tt> to <tt>end</tt>.&nbsp; Once you both have decided on an algorithm, complete the body of the block.&nbsp; Now, run the script with <tt>max</tt> set to <tt>10</tt>.&nbsp;
Run it a few times to get an idea of the average time the computer
takes to generate this list (to the nearest tenth of a second); you
don't need to be exact!&nbsp; Repeat the experiment with <tt>max</tt> set to <tt>20</tt>, <tt>40</tt>, <tt>100</tt>, <tt>200</tt>, and <tt>1000</tt>.&nbsp; Do you see a pattern?
