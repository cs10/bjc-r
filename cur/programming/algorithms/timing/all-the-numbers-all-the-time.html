<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this section, we will be using <a href="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab08/Complexity/timing.ypr">this timing framework</a>. &Acirc;&nbsp;It is very similar to the framework you constructed earlier, but it also has the stubs for a few blocks that we will be filling in. &Acirc;&nbsp;The first block that we will fill in is already on stage:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img title="Insert all numbers between 'start' and 'end' into 'list'" alt="Insert all numbers between 'start' and 'end' into 'list'" src="/bjc-r/img/list/insert-all-numbers-block.png" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab08/Complexity/InsertAllNumbers.jpg"></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This block should fill the input list with all of the numbers from <tt>start</tt> to <tt>end</tt>. &Acirc;&nbsp;If working correctly, the version used on stage should generate all of the numbers from <tt>1</tt> to <tt>max</tt>, where <tt>max</tt> is a number that we will change when running timing experiments, and should add them to the <tt>numbers</tt> list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, talk to your partner and discuss an algorithm that you can use to fill the input list with all of the numbers from <tt>start</tt> to <tt>end</tt>. &Acirc;&nbsp;Once you both have decided on an algorithm, complete the body of the block. &Acirc;&nbsp;Now, run the script with <tt>max</tt> set to <tt>10</tt>. &Acirc;&nbsp;Run it a few times to get an idea of the average time the computer takes to generate this list (to the nearest tenth of a second); you don't need to be exact! &Acirc;&nbsp;Repeat the experiment with <tt>max</tt> set to <tt>20</tt>, <tt>40</tt>, <tt>100</tt>, <tt>200</tt>, and <tt>1000</tt>. &Acirc;&nbsp;Do you see a pattern?</p>   </body></html>
