<p>We have provided a starter file and imported and initialized all the functions you will need. 
</p>
<h3>Question 1:</h3>
<p>You will now write a function that takes in a string of text, and a string of color and prints the given text into the given color. Be sure to have your function set the text color back to default after changing it. 
</p>
<p>Hint: Think about the specific attributes that Fore has, how can you access attributes using another way besides dot notation? 
</p>

<h3>Question 2:</h3>
<p>Now try writing a function that takes in a string of text and prints the given text onto a given background color.  Be sure to have your function set the background color back to default after changing it. 
</p>

<h3>Question 3:</h3>
<p>Finally, write a function that takes in a string of text and prints the given text with the given level of brightness. Be sure to have your function set the brightness level back to default after changing it.  
</p>

<h3>Putting it all together:</h3>
<p>We have provided a text file for you to parse through and apply what you have learned to change the terminal display given conditions. Change each word in the text according to the follwoing conditions.</p>
<ol>
    <li>If the length of the word is greater than or equal to 6, change the color of the text to blue. 
    <li>If the word contains the letter 't', change the background color to yellow. 
    <li>If the word ends with the letter 'e', change the background color to green. 
    <li>If the word is a palindrome, change the brightness of the word to bright. 
</ol>

<p>Congratulations! Now you know how to make your terminal look pretty! </p>
