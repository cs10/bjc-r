<p>We have provided a starter file and imported and initialized all the functions you will need. 
</p>
<h3>Question 1:</h3>
<p>You will now write a function that takes in a string of text, and a string of color and prints the given text into the given color. Be sure to have your function set the text color back to default after changing it.

</p>

<h3>Question 3:</h3>
<p>Finally, write a function that takes in a string of text and prints the given text with the given level of brightness. Be sure to have your function set the brightness level back to default after changing it.  
</p>

<h3>Putting it all together:</h3>
<p>We have provided a text file for you to parse through and apply what you have learned to change the terminal display given conditions. </p>
