    	<h3>What is MoviePy?</h3>
      <p>
        Let us introduce a new Python library that can show you some other ways that python can be useful.
        One very interesting library, is called MoviePy, which can be used for local video and audio editing,
        all through python code.
      </p>
      <h3>Downloading MoviePy</h3>
      <p>
        To use MoviePy on your local device, you need to first download the library through your terminal.
        To download the library, enter the following code into your terminal.
      </p>
      <p><pre><code>
(For Mac - in the code below you can also replace 'python3' with 'python' if you have an older version)
Alonzos-Laptop:~ alonzo$$ python3 -m pip install moviepy

(For Windows)
Alonzos-Laptop:~ alonzo$$ py -m pip install moviepy
    </code></pre></p>
    <p>
      That is all that is necessary to get the MoviePy Library onto your device! Next you will need to download
      the starter files for this lab, which can be found <a href="/bjc-r/prog/python/moviepy.zip">here</a>.
      Now, let's take a look at some of the functions within MoviePy and how the library can be best used for
      video and audio editing!
