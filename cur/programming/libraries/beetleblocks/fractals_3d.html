    <p>As the title implies, for this section we will be making fractals from Lab 10 in 3D!</p>
	<p>For this first exercise, implement the tree fractal block in Beetle Blocks such that the tree grows upward the z axis.</p>

    <p>A tree growing upward, is exciting but let&apos;s go a step further. The tree at the moment, though now 3D, is very flat. Why not utilize the extra space and add extra sides to the tree to round it out like a real tree? Fill in and implement the 3d tree block so that it can produce a tree with as many sides as you want.</p>

    <p>Now for the second exercise, let&apos;s create a six-sided snowflake that also has another six sides from another direction. First, implement the snowflake fractal in Beetle Blocks. At this point, create a new block 3D snowflake using the snowflake block which draws three snowflakes intersecting each other through the center and producing six points from the top view. <i>(Hint: Pay attention to the angle the snowflake picture is on)</i></p>
