    <p><a href="http://beetleblocks.com/">Beetle Blocks</a> is a Snap! extension that allows for 3D modelling. Just as Snap! allows you to draw with your sprite on a 2 dimensional surface, Beetle Blocks allows you to do the same on a 3 dimensional area. Being able to design things this way on Beetle Blocks allows it to be used in real life applications like 3D printing.</p>
