			The sprite occupies a position (x,y) on the stage where x represents the horizontal position, from -240 (left) to 240 (right), and y represents the vertical position, from -180 (bottom) to 180 (top). Here's a picture:

			The black sprite is at the center of the stage, called the <em>origin, </em>with coordinates (0, 0).
			The green sprite is to the right of the origin, so its x position is positive; it's below the origin,
			so its y position is negative. Each grid line above represents 20 steps, so the green sprite's coordinates are (140, -100).
			 Take some time to make sure you understand this, discussing it with your partner or classmate.
