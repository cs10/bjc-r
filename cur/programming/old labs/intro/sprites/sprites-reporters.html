        	<strong>Sensor Blocks</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        	At the bottom of Motion palette are three blocks
   shaped differently from the others. These oval-shaped blocks are called  <em>reporters</em>.  Unlike the jigsaw-puzzle-piece-shaped
   <em>command</em> blocks we've used until now, reporters don't carry
   out an action (such as moving the sprite  or displaying a speech
   balloon) by themselves.  Instead, they <em>report</em> a value,
   usually for use in another block's input slot.   </p>
        <p>
        	The <img
   src="../../../../../img/topic1/topic1_xposition.png" alt="X Position
   Reporter"/> and <img
   src="../../../../../img/topic1/topic1_yposition.png" alt="Y Position
   Reporter"/> reporters tell you where the sprite
   is on the stage.  As in algebra, <b>x</b> means left-to-right
   position, and <b>y</b> means bottom-to-top position.
</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Drag an <b>x position</b> block into the
            scripting area and click on it.  You should see a little speech
          </li> balloon next to the block: <img src="../../../../../img/topic1/xpos-bubble.png" alt="X Position
   speech balloon"/>
          <ul></ul><li>Now, click on the sprite itself, drag it somewhere
            else and click on the <b>x position</b> block again.</li>
          <ul></ul><li>
            Click on the gray box to the left of the <b>x position</b> block in
            the palette, and then look over to the stage. You will see that the
            value that the block would report is displayed on the stage:
          </li>
        
   <img src="../../../../../img/topic1/palette-checkbox.png"
   alt="X Position block's checkbox"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="../../../../../img/topic1/watcher.png" alt="X Position stage
   watcher"/> </ul>
<p>This on-stage display is called a <em>watcher</em>.</p>
<div>
  <div class="sidenote">You can also mark your stage with axes so that <em>you</em> can see  the approximate coordinates of the sprite. UNFINISHED TEXT AND  PICTURE SHOWING HOW</div></div>
<ul>
  <li>Create a watcher for <b>y position</b>  and also for <b>direction</b>. Move the sprite around, using commands or just by dragging, and see how the values reported by these blocks change.</li>
</ul>
