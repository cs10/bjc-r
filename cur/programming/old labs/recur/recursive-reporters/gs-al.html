<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<p>You're in a class with a total of five students: Rocky, Bullwinkle, Peabody, Sherman, and <u>(your name here)</u>. You want to choose a committee to get the refreshments for the class party.  Remember that "Rocky and Sherman" is the same committee as "Sherman and Rocky."</p>
<ol>
<li>How many different committees of three people include Bullwinkle?</li>
<li>How many different committees of three people <em>don't</em> include Bullwinkle?</li>
<li><div><div class="sidenote">Some people call this the ``distinguished member method.''   Bullwinkle is the distinguished member.  You count all the committees that contain Bullwinkle, then count all the committees that don't, and then ... .</div></div> How many different committees of three people are there in a group of 5 students?</li>
</li></ol></div>

<ol start="4">
<li>How many 2-person committees can you make from 5 students??</li>
<li><div><div class="sidenote">One idea:  use the result of problem~\ref{fipro} and the distinguished member method.</div></div>How many 3-person committees can you make from 6 students?</li>
<li>How many 1 member committees can you form from 100 students?</li>
<li>How many 99 member committees can you form from 100 students?</li>
<li>How many 100 member committees can you form from 100 students?</li>
<li><div><div class="sidenote">How can you have a committee with~0 members?  Find a way for that to make sense..</div></div> How many 0 member committees can you form from 100 students?</li>
 
<li>Describe the ``distinguished member method'' in words, so precisely that others in your class understand it.
