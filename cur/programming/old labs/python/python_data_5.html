		PlaintextCorpusReader type is made up of a list of fileids, which are made up of a list of paragraphs, which is in turn made up of a list of sentences, which is in turn made up of a list of words.<br />

	In this section, lets investigate the use of basketball language in Jay Z's lyrics. Go ahead and save all the album titles by typing in <code>Albums = wordlist.fileids()</code>. 
	Notice that JayZ_ text appears before each of the filenames. To get this prefix out of the filename, we extracted the first five characters, using <code>fileid[5:]</code>.
<p/>
<pre>
	<code>
[fileid[5:] for fileid in Albums[:14]]
	</code>
</pre>
<p>
	We are ready to start mining the data. So let's do a simple analysis on the occurence of the concept "basketball" in JayZ's lyrics as represented by the list of 40 terms that are common when we talk about basketball.<br />
	
</p>

<p>
<pre>
	<code>
basketball_bag_of_words = ['bounce','crossover','technical',
 'shooting','double','jump','goal','backdoor','chest','ball',
 'team','block','throw','offensive','point','airball','pick',
 'assist','shot','layup','break','dribble','roll','cut','forward',
 'move','zone','three-pointer','free','post','fast','blocking','backcourt',
 'violation','foul','field','pass','turnover','alley-oop','guard']
	</code>
</pre>
</p>

<p>
	Lets reduce our investigation of this concept to just the American Gangster album, which is the first 14 songs in the corpus. We do that by using the command <code>Albums[:14]</code>. Remember that <code>Albums</code> is just a list data type, so we can slice it, to its first 14 indexes. 
</p>

<p>
The following code converts the words in the basket ball concept to lowercase using <code>w.lower()</code>, then checks if they start with any of the "targets", that is, each of the words in the <code>basketball_bag_of_words</code>, using the command <code>startswith()</code>. Thus, it will count words like turnover, alley-oop and so on. All this is enabled by NLTK's built in function for <i>Conditional Frequency Distribution</i>. You can read more about it <a href="http://www.nltk.org/book/ch02.html#conditional-frequency-distributions">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
	<code>
>> cfd = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(
	(target, fileid[5:])
	for fileid in Albums[:14]
	for w in wordlist.words(fileid)
	for target in basketball_bag_of_words
	if w.lower().startswith(target))<br />
>> cfd.plot()
	</code>
</pre></p>

<img src="/bjc-r/img/python/cfd_data.png" alt="cfd data plot"/>
    <p>
     From the plot we see that the basketball term "roll" seems to be used extensively in the song <i>Party Life</i>. Let's take a closer look at this phenomenon, and determine if "roll" was used in the "basketball" sense of the term. To do this, we need to see the context in which it was used. So, lets build a concordance. <br />
	The first thing I want to do is to create a corpus that only contain words from the American Gangster album.
    </p>
    <p>
    <pre><code>
>> AmericanGangster_wordlist = PlaintextCorpusReader(corpus_root, 'JayZ_American Gangster_.*')
>> AmericanGangster_corpus = create_corpus(AmericanGangster_wordlist, []) 
    </code></pre></p>
    
    <p>
    Building a concordance, gets us to the area of elementary information retrieval (IR)<a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a>, think, <i> basic search engine</i>. So why do we even need to "normalize" terms? We want to match <b>U.S.A.</b> and <b>USA</b>. Also when we enter <b>roll</b>, we would like to match <b>Roll</b>, and <b>rolling</b>. One way to do this is to stem the word. That is, reduce it down to its base/stem/root form. As such <b>automate(s)</b>, <b>automatic</b>, <b>automation</b> all reduced to <b>automat</b>. Most stemmers are pretty basic and just chop off standard affixes indicating things like tense (e.g., "-ed") and possessive forms (e.g., "-'s"). Here, we'll use the most popular english language stemmer, the Potter stemmer, which comes with NLTK. 
    </p>
    <p>
	Once our tokens are stemmed, we can rest easy knowing that roll, Rolling, Rolls will all stem to roll.
    </p>

<p>
    <pre>
    	<code>
>>porter = nltk.PorterStemmer()
>>stemmed_tokens = [porter.stem(t) for t in AmericanGangster_corpus]
>>for token in sorted(set(stemmed_tokens))[860:870]:
	print token + ' [' + str(stemmed_tokens.count(token)) + ']'
dummi [1]
dump [1]
dure [1]
each [1]
earlob [1]
eas [1]
easel [1]
easi [1]
easili [1]
eat [5]
    	</code>
    </pre></p>
    <p>
    Now we can go ahead and create a concordance to test if roll is used in the basketball (pick and roll) sense or not.
    </p>

 <p>
    <pre>
    	<code>
>>AmericanGangster_lyrics = IndexedText(porter, AmericanGangster_corpus)
>>AmericanGangster_lyrics.concordance('roll')

    </pre></p>

 <p>
 Based on the context, you can decide if the word "roll" is used in a basketball sense. This is really where the "art" of the word "Arts and Sciences" comes to play in Data Science and NLP.
