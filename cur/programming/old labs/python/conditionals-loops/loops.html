              There are two essential kinds of loop in (also in most of other text programming languages as well) Python, they are For-Loop and While-Loop.
          </p>
          <p>
              <table>
                  <tr>
                      <td><img src="../../../../../img/python/for1to10.png" alt="for-loop"/></td>
                      <td>
                          <pre><code>
for i in range(x, y):
    do something
                              </code></pre>
                  </tr>
              </table>
          </p>
          <p>
              This for-loop will "do something" y times, unless specified.
              <br /><br />
              <b>Note:</b>
              <br /><br />
              The range function can also be written with one argument like this: <code>range(y):</code><br /> This just means that you're not explicitly telling it to start from a specific number but rather from 0 to y - 1.<br />
              Also, there are many ways that we can utilize a for-loop. Let's consider a list, just like in <span class="snap">snap</span>. Let's call this list <code>lst</code>.<br /> Then we can also do this with a for-loop: <code>for i in lst:</code><br /><br />
              There are other cool things we can do with a for-loop, you will learn these tools as you become more familiar with Python.

              <table>
                  <tr>
                      <td><img src="../../../../../img/python/repeatuntilnot.png" alt="repeat-until"/></td>
                      <td>
                          <pre><code>
while (condition):
    do something
                        </code></pre>
                  </tr>
              </table>
        </p>
        <p>
            This while-loop will "do something" as long as "condition" remains true.
            <br /><br />

            Let's take a look at some examples:<br />
            <pre><code>
def add_one_n_times(n):
    if (n < 0):
        return n
    else:
        result = 0
        for i in range(n):
            result += 1
        return result
                </code></pre>
                <pre><code>
# If you notice the "report" block in Snap!, we can't attach anything <br />
# after that block. That is because it will terminate the function <br />
# immediately after that statement is executed. The concept is the same <br />
# in Python, after the "return" statement is executed, the whole function <br />
# terminates.
>>> add_one_n_times(-5)
-5
>>> add_one_n_time(5)
5
            </code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's write another function <code>min(x, y, z)</code> using only a while loop. Note that this function will only work for <b>all positive values</b>.

            <pre> <code>
def min(x, y, z):
    m = 0
    while (x != 0 and y != 0 and z != 0):
        x -= 1
        y -= 1
        z -= 1
        m += 1
    return m
            </code></pre>
        </p>

            Quick Quiz: (discuss with your partner, verify with TA for answer)<br />
            1. How can we write <code>add_one_n_times(n)</code> using a while loop instead of a for loop. <br />
            2. What is the difference between a while loop in Python and a repeat until in <span class="snap">snap</span>?<br />
