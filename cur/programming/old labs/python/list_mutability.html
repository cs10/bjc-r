            Changing lists needs to be done with care. In Python, when a list is "copied" to another variable, the list is not actually replicated, both variables now simply point to the same list.

            This is an important property of Python. <b>Mutability</b> is the ability for certain types of data to be changed without entirely recreating it. This is important for Python to run programs both quickly and efficiently.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Mutability varies between different data types in Python. A list is <b>mutable</b>, as demonstrated above. Conversely, a string is not mutable <b>(immutable)</b>. Modifying a string creates a new one as demonstrated here:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
>>> a = "potato"
>>> b = a
>>> a += a
>>> a
"potatopotato"
>>> b
"potato"
        </code></pre></p>
        <p class="alert quoteOrange">
            You may have noticed that this behavior is exactly the same as what happens in <span class="snap">Snap</span>.  In <span class="snap">Snap</span> lists are mutable and strings are immutable. 
        </p>
        <p>
    To make a true separate copy of a list, use the <code>[:]</code> operator. This operator iterates through every item of the list and copies each item into a new list.
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
>>> your_music = ["Billy Jean", "Day Tripper", "Bohemian Rhapsody"]
>>> my_music = your_music[:]
>>> my_music
["Billy Jean", "Day Tripper", "Bohemian Rhapsody"]
        </code></pre></p>
        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
            <b>Note:</b> Please don't try this at home. Copying music is illegal. This demonstration was done using a professional programmer on a closed course. ;-)
        </p>
        <p>
If an item of the original list is modified, the copy remains unchanged.
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
>>> your_music[1] = "Time"
>>> your_music
["Billy Jean", "Time", "Bohemian Rhapsody"]
>>> my_music
["Billy Jean", "Day Tripper", "Bohemian Rhapsody"]
        </code></pre></p>
        <p>
Even though an entry of your_music is modified, my_music remains as it was originally copied.
