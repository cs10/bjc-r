            Welcome back! This is the fourth and final assignment in the BJDS curriculum, so congratulations for making it this far!
        </p>

        <p>
            In this assignment we will be exploring <b>data visualization</b>. Data visualization is important for being able to display data analysis in a way that anyone,
            including people who do not have a data science background, can understand and learn from. It is also important as a tool that helps data scientists learn about
            their data and draw data-driven conclusions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Data can be visualized in many different ways depending on the content of the data and the intended conclusion. As we answer questions about data using the
            querying blocks we have learned about in previous assignments, we can also choose how we want to visually represent those answers to other data scientists or
            to the general public. This means that we not only need to understand how the visualization blocks themselves work, but also how to best use them in practice.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this assignment, we will be introducing 4 data visualization techniques in DASIS: <code>horizontal bar</code>, <code>histogram</code>,
            <code>scatter plot</code>, and <code>line plot</code>. Each of these visualizations has different uses that we will discuss in this assignment.
        </p>

        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
            If you ever want to save a visualization you made, you can right-click the stage and select <code>pic...</code> to save the  stage as a <code>.png</code> file!
        </p>

        <p>
            The starter code for this assignment can be downloaded by clicking <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/data_science/code/assignment4.xml" download> this link</a>.
            As was the case last time, you can drag this into the <a href = "https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html" target="_blank"> Snap<em>!</em> interface</a> to work with the code.
        </p>

        <p>
            Alternatively, if you want the default DASIS envorinment again, you can download it in a new file by clicking
            <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/data_science/code/DASIS.xml" download> this link</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="alert quoteOrange">
            Remember to make sure that you are in <b>Turbo mode</b>, which is very important for making data visualizations in Snap<em>!</em>.
            To ensure you are, you can check the settings in the top left of the screen.
