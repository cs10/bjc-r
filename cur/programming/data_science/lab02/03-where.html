        <p>
            The <code>WHERE</code> block is a block we can use to filter out rows we don't want and keep the ones we do.
            You can think of the <code>WHERE</code> block as being similar to the <b>keep</b> HOF block in Snap<em>!</em>,
            where you use a boolean condition to keep certain rows and discard others.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Table that results from a <code>WHERE</code> block call has <b>at most the same number of rows</b>
            (if you didn't filter any rows out), but <b>typically fewer rows</b> than the original table, and it will also
            have the <b>same number of columns</b> as the original Table. The order of the rows in the new Table will be
            the same as their order in the original Table, just with the unkept rows omitted.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <code>WHERE</code> block takes in 5 arguments, with the third argument being optional. These arguments are:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li> A Table </li>
            <li> A column label or index to use as the keeping values </li>
            <li> A modifying reporter function to apply to the column argument before keeping (optional) </li>
            <li> A boolean to indicate whether to keep or discard a row </li>
            <li> The threshold value you want to use as the border between keeping and discarding a row </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
            As with the <code>ORDER</code> block, the third argument should be left blank if you do not want to use it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's see examples of the <code>WHERE</code> block in use.

            To see only the rows in the <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/taxi-data.png" alt="Taxi data" style="width:7%"> Table
            where the passengers were dropped off in <b>Queens</b>, we can use the following query:
        </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/taxi-data-dropoff-queens.png" alt="Dropoff in Queens" style="width:80%">
        </div>

        <p>
            And to see the rows where the passengers were dropped off in <b>Manhattan</b>, we can use a similar query:
        </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/taxi-data-dropoff-manhattan.png" alt="Dropoff in Queens" style="width:80%">
