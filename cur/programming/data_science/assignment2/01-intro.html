            Welcome back! In the last assignment we learned about Tables. We learned how we can create them,
            how we can ask for some of their data, and how we can answer questions using that data.
            In this assigmnent, we will be introducing new tools to our data science toolkit. We will
            see several new Table methods that we can use to make more detailed <b>queries</b> of a Table!
        </p>

        <p>
            During this assignment, we will see numerous new DASIS blocks. As a general rule,
            each time you learn about a new DASIS block, you can always feel free to take a bit of time
            to explore the block on your own and see what it is capable of outside of the few examples we
            have listed in this assignment. Data science, like any other skill, is one best built with practice!
        </p>

        <p>
            The starter code for this assignment can be downloaded by clicking <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/data_science/code/assignment2.xml" download> this link</a>.
            As was the case last time, you can drag this into the <a href = "https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html" target="_blank"> Snap<em>!</em> interface</a> to work with the code.
        </p>

        <p>
            Alternatively, if you want the default DASIS envorinment again, you can download it in a new file by clicking
            <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/data_science/code/DASIS.xml" download> this link</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            For this assigmnent, we will be using the same Table from the first assignment which contained data about
            New York Taxis. If you do not have that Table available from the last assignment, that is absolutely alright,
            as the Snap<em>!</em> file for this assignment allows you to import the Table again!
        </p>

        <p>
            A couple notes on this assignment:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li> An <b>index</b> is the position of an item in a list. When referring to a column's index, it means the position of the
            column in the Table. The column's <b>name</b> or <b>label</b> is the text that represents the column. </li>

            <li> When doing queries, it is usually best to keep your original Table (whether created from scratch
                or imported using a .csv file) in tact. This means that any queries or changes involving the Table
                should be done with script variables to avoid changing the original Table. You will see examples
                of this several times during this assignment. </li>
        </ul>
