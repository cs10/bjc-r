        <p>
            So far we have learned about several helpful querying methods, but there is a useful ability these blocks do not yet provide us.
            This is the ability to group rows based on their values in a given row, which can help us learn about the contents of a dataset. In the taxis example
            from Assignments 1 and 2, this may have involved grouping the rides based on <code>pickup_borough</code> to see the distribution of
            where rides originated.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this assginment, we will introduce the <code>GROUP</code> and <code>PIVOT</code> blocks as 2 different ways to groups rows and learn about
            a dataset. This will be particularly important in the next assignment when we talk about visualizing data. Being able to categorize data based
            on a given column's information will allow us to visualize different characteristics of the data in ways that non-programmers
            (the majority of people who interact with data are people unfamiliar with programming) will understand.
