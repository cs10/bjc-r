            Welcome back! In the last assignment we learned about many different Table querying methods. The 2 methods we will be covering in this assignment,
            <code>GROUP</code> and <code>PIVOT</code>, are a bit more complicated and will therefore have an entire assignment devoted to learning how they work.
        </p>

        <p>
            During this assignment, we will see 2 new DASIS blocks. As a general rule,
            each time you learn about a new DASIS block, you can always feel free to take a bit of time
            to explore the block on your own and see what it is capable of outside of the few examples we
            have listed in this assignment. Data science, like any other skill, is one best built with practice!
        </p>

        <p>
            The starter code for this assignment can be downloaded by clicking <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/data_science/code/assignment3.xml" download> this link</a>.
            As was the case last time, you can drag this into the <a href = "https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html" target="_blank"> Snap<em>!</em> interface</a> to work with the code.
        </p>

        <p>
            Alternatively, if you want the default DASIS envorinment again, you can download it in a new file by clicking
            <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/data_science/code/DASIS.xml" download> this link</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            For this assigmnent, we will be using a dataset containing movie data. We will talk more about the dataset before we dive into the new blocks.
