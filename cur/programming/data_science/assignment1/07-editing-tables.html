            At some point, we may want to add additional data to an existing Table. When adding data to a Table, always remember
            to make sure your new column/row has the correct number of items to match with the Table.
            Let's try adding one new row and one new column to our Table by running the following blocks in this order:
        </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/add-row.png" alt="Add row" style="width:43%"/>

            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/add-col.png" alt="Add column" style="width:42%"/>
        
            <p style="clear:both";></p>
        </div>

        <p class="alert quoteRed">
            Note that we had to use a 'set' block to see the Table change. The <b>ADD (non-permanent)</b> alone is just a reporter and will not change the table itself.
            There are command block versions of the <b>ADD</b> blocks that make the changes to the actual Table, so when using those be
            careful not to overwrite data. We recommend using the reporter versions for now.
        </p>

        <p>
            What happens when we try to add a column or row with an incorrect number of values? Try adding this row and this column to
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/our-table.png" alt="Our table" style="width:8%"/>:
        </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/add-row-error.png" alt="Add row error" style="width:43%"/>

            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/add-col-error.png" alt="Add column error" style="width:42%"/>
        
            <p style="clear:both";></p>
        </div>

        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
            Note the error message here. This may be a common mistake at first, so if you see this error message
            make sure to check that the number of items you are adding to the table is valid.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/our-table.png" alt="Our table" style="width:8%"/> has 3 columns,
            adding this row with 2 values does not work. The same goes for adding the column with 3 values
            because <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/our-table.png" alt="Our table" style="width:8%"/> has 5 rows.
            Think about what you could do to the proposed row and column to allow them to be added to the Table successfully.
        </p>
