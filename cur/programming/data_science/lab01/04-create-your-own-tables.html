        <p>
            Tables are a great way to store data. We can either <b>create a Table on our own</b> from scratch
            (by typing in the data manually) or we can <b>import</b> a table using a <em>.csv</em>
            file.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, let's see how we can make a Table on our own from scratch. We will do this using the following block:
        </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/create-textual.png" alt="Create your own Table" style="width:50%"/>
        </div>

        <p>
            This block takes in 2 arguments: <b>a string that represents the data</b>, and <b>a list of column names</b>.
            Rows are separated by semicolons and rows are split into columns using commas. Every row must have the same number of columns,
            and you must provide a name for every column. Create a global variable called 
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/our-table.png" alt="Create your own Table" style="width:8%"/>
            and run the block below to create your own new Table!
        </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/created-textual-table.png" alt="Create your own Table" width="500" height="auto"/>
        </div>

        <p class="alert quoteOrange">
            Note that typing in your own data presents a bit of a challenging task because you have to make
            sure you type the data perfectly, and also ensure all your syntax is correct. This is why we will also talk
            later in this lab about using <em>.csv</em> files, or <b>C</b>omma <b>S</b>eparated <b>V</b>alue files, to import your data.
            These files already have all the data typed out with the correct syntax, so you won't have to worry about it!
        </p>
