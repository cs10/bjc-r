            Write a block
            that draws a full flower in the middle of the stage.
        </p>

        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
            Write simple custom blocks, or borrow from blocks you have already written, and then use those blocks
            inside your <code>draw a flower</code> block.  If you can, write blocks of intermediate complexity that
            use and are used by other blocks you write.
            <br>
            <br>
            You might write:
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>draw flower head with ...</code>
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>draw stem with length []</code>
            <br>
            <br>
            but don't feel constrained by this list.
        </p>
        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
            Use several inputs that control
            aspects of what the flower should look like.  You might change the number of petals, the size of the petals, the shape of the petals, or something else!
        </p>
        <p>After you've worked on this for a bit, take a moment to look at what other students
            have done and chat.  If you see something nice, spend some time trying to incorporate that design
            into your program.</p>
