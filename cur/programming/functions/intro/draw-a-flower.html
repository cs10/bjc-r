            Write a block
            that draws a full flower in the middle of the stage.

            Write simple custom blocks, or borrow from blocks you have already written, and then use those blocks
            inside your <code>draw a flower</code> block.  If you can, write blocks of intermediate complexity that
            use and are used by other blocks you write.
            <br>
            <br>
            You might write:
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>draw flower head with ...</code>
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>draw stem with length []</code>
            <br>
            <br>
            but don't feel constrained by this list.
        </p>
        <p class="quoteBrown">
            Use several inputs that control
            aspects of what the flower should look like.  You might change the number of petals,
        </p>
        <p>After you've worked on this for a bit, take a moment to look at what other students
            have done and chat.  If you see something nice, spend some time trying to incorporate that design
            into your program.</p>
