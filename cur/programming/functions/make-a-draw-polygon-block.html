        <p>
            Now, you are going to make a block that takes two inputs.

        </p>
        <p>
            We want to create a <code>draw polygon</code> block that takes as inputs:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                a number of
                sides and
            </li>
            <li>
                the length of each side.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/polyblock.png" alt="draw polygon () sides of length ()">

      <p>
        In the block, call these inputs <code>sides</code> and <code>length</code>.
        This exercise should be done with a partner, so introduce yourself
        to your neighbor and get started on the exercise together.

            You should remember from
            <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/loops/repeat-n/draw-regular-polygons-with-repeat.html">this
            lesson</a> how to draw a regular polygon. How many degrees altogether?
            How many turns?
        </p>
        <p>
            Be sure to test out your solution with several polygons, with different 
            lengths and number of sides.
