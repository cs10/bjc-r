            It's the end of the topic, so it's time to go a bit crazy.

            Draw a field of flowers, and give each flower a different color, size, shape, position, and so forth.   
            Use some of the simple custom blocks you've already written, and write new custom blocks 
            that make use of those simpler blocks to do complicated things.
            <br><br>
            Use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="repeat block">
            to draw lots of flowers, flowers with lots of petals, and so forth.  
            <br><br>
            Use 
            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-empty-args.png" alt="pick random block">
            as much as you can to make the flowers interesting and different.

        </p>
        
        <p>Here is a custom block (from someone who went crazy) to give you some ideas:</p>
        <img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/drawing/crazy-draw-flower-block.png" alt="crazy complicated draw flower block with tons of inputs">
        
        <p>And, you could use <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/drawing/draw-field-of-flowers-with-backgrounds.xml">this
            starter project</a>, which contains a few fun backgrounds.  To use them, click on the <code>Stage</code> sprite 
            at the lower right of the <span class="snap">snap</span> window, select the <code>Costumes</code> tab at the
            top of the scripting area, and select the background that you want for your program.
