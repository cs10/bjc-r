    	<h2>Timing Sum-thing's Up</h2>
		<div class="todo">Need a new title. --MF</div>
        <p>We will now see an example where the runtime of an algorithm really does make a difference. Remember the game you played with young Gauss at the beginning of lab? We will implement the game in <span class="snap">snap</span>.</p>
		<div class="comment">This was a link to <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/loops/sum-things-up.html" target="_blank">/bjc-r/cur/programming/loops/sum-things-up.html</a>, but that's not in the lab anymore, so what is the right thing? --MF</div>
        <p><a href="">Earlier in the lab</a>, you made a block that returned the sum of numbers between 1 and <code>max</code>. In the "Variables" palette, you will see two blocks:
		</p>
		<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r//img/list/add-numbers-to-list-blocks.png" alt="add all numbers in list" title="add all numbers in list" />
		<p>The first block sums up the numbers in the <code>numbers</code> list the normal, "non-Gauss" way: walking through the list and adding the numbers one by one. The second block sums up the numbers the "Gauss" way: using the formula 
        $$(N + 1) \times (N ÷ 2)$$
         where, in this case, <em>N</em> is the same as <code>max</code>. (<a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/2-algorithm-complexity/2-competing-with-young-gauss.html">How did we get this formula?</a>)</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
                <li>Complete the bodies of these blocks.</li>
                <li>Once you are done, drag the first block (the "non-Gauss" block) onto the stage and place it immediately after the <code>add all numbers between 1 and max</code> block.</li>
                <li>Then, move the <code>reset timer</code> block <em>after</em> the <code>add all numbers between 1 and max</code> block, since we only need to time how long the "non-Gauss" block takes to sum the numbers in the <code>numbers</code> list.</li>
                <li>Now, run the script with <code>max</code> set to 10. Again, run it a few times to get an idea of the average time the computer takes to sum the numbers up.</li>
                <li>
                    Repeat the experiment with <code>max</code> set to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>20</li>
                        <li>40</li>
                        <li>100</li>
                        <li>1000</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />Based on your observations, what kind of runtime does the "non-Gauss" block have: constant, linear, or neither? Why do you think this is the case?</li>
                <li>Replace the "non-Gauss" block with the "Gauss" block and run the script once more with <code>max</code> set to 10. Again, run it a few times to get an idea of the average time the computer takes to sum the numbers up.</li>
                <li>
                	Repeat the experiment with <code>max</code> set to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>20</li>
                        <li>40</li>
                        <li>100</li>
                        <li>1000</li>
