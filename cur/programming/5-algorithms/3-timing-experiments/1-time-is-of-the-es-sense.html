    	<h2>Timing a Reporter</h2>
		<div class="todo">This lab needs a getting started...</div>
        <p>
        	We have seen how Snap<em>!</em> can be programmed to wait for a certain time before reporting anything. Snap<em>!</em>  also allows us to do the converse: to report how long a program takes to finish. In the "Sensing" palette, you will see a command called <code>reset timer</code> and a reporter called <code>timer</code>:
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/lab-8/reset-timer.JPG" alt="Reset Timer Command" title="Reset Timer Command" />
        </p>
    	<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Activate the <code>timer</code> reporter (click the checkbox), and you should see a timer ticking away in the top left corner of the stage. It's been ticking ever since you opened Snap<em>!</em>, and it counts in tenths of a second:<br />
					<div class="sidenote">We are going to be performing timing experiments in the following sections, so this timer will prove useful.</div>
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/lab-8/timer-ticking-on-stage-snap.png" alt="Timer ticking away" title="Timer ticking away" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    Build following timing script in Snap<em>!</em> :<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/lab-8/timing-framework.png" alt="Timing Framework" title="Timing Framework" />
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>This script will reset the timer whenever the green flag is pressed. The sprite will say "Hello!" for 1 second, then say the current time (less 1 second to account for how long the sprite said "Hello!").</p>
        <p>If we replace "Hello!" with a reporter, then the sprite will say the value reported by reporter, and one second later, it will say how long the reporter took to generate that response: this is the timing information that we need for the upcoming pages in this lab.</p>
