<h2>Who's In Charge?</h2>
<p>As you saw from the traceroute activity earlier, the computers and the interconnections among them don't belong to any one organization. Most of the major Internet Service Providers in the US are telephone companies or cable companies, although typically within a large organization the Internet connections are provided by the organization itself. So who's in charge of the network overall?</p>
<p>Some people like to believe that nobody's in charge&mdash;that everyone just cooperates freely with no central organization. It's true that free cooperation plays an important role; companies allow competitors' packets to be routed through their systems, for example. But all those protocols didn't just grow in the wild; <em>someone</em> designed IP, designed TCP, and so on. And you can't just pick any IP address or host name you want, or else there would be conflicts. We can't start a server named bjc.org, because that name is already in use (by a health care provider in St. Louis, Missouri).</p>
<p>The simplest answer, but a somewhat misleading one, is that the US government is in charge, because it has authority over the root zone of the DNS hierarchy. If you think it's strange for one country to control a worldwide network, you're not alone, but we'll get to that shortly. This situation is a result of the history of the creation of the Internet.</p>
<p>In 1968, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the US Department of Defense, which was at that time the largest funder of computer science research in the world, announced that they were funding development of a large-scale packet switched network. The engineering of the ARPANET was done by a research company, Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN). In 1969 the first connections were made among four university research groups in California and Utah. At its peak, the ARPANET reached a few hundred computers. Individual people and commercial businesses weren't allowed on the net; all those computers were owned either by military installations or by computer science research labs, mostly at universities. (This will be important when we discuss Internet security later.)</p>
<p>By today's standards the ARPANET was tiny, but it was the testbed for the protocols that became the technical basis for the Internet. And it belonged to the US military. That's how the US came to be in charge of the Internet. Once IP was invented in 1982, the ARPANET itself became just one network among many, and in fact it was decommissioned in 1990. The military installations had been moved to a separate network (but connected to the other networks using IP), and the core of a new cross-country network was built by the National Science Foundation, a civilian agency of the US government, in 1981. At that time businesses still weren't allowed on NSF's CSNET, but there was a clear demand for networking of businesses, and commercial IP-based networks were created. But during all this time, the assignment of both IP addresses and host names were controlled first by ARPA and later by NSF. When the commercial use of the Internet became larger than the research use, that control was passed to the US Department of Commerce, which is still officially in control of the root of the domain namespace and of allocation of IP addresses.</p>
<p>But in practice the Department of Commerce doesn't run the Internet directly. Instead, they have contracted out various functions to a number of different organizations, some of which are businesses running part of the network for profit, and others are nonprofit organizations. Only very rarely has the US government overruled these organizations. In 2009, the Department of Commerce signed an agreement making the Internet governing bodies more autonomous, although they do still have some contractual obligations to the US.</p>
<div class="takeNote">
  <p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is in charge of developing and approving the protocols that make up the Internet protocol suite. IETF members are self-appointed; the work of the IETF is done largely by email among subcommittee members for each protocol, and anyone with the necessary expertise can join these mailing lists. Decisions are made by consensus (everyone has to agree to a change), never by voting. The idea is that if a proposal is controversial enough to need a vote, it should be improved until everyone's objections are satisfied.</p></div>
  <div class="forYouToDo">
    <p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is the central authority for IP addresses and for top-level domains such as <code>com</code> and <code>edu</code>. ICANN directly manages the root zone of the DNS, but contracts out the management of individual domains to other organizations, usually businesses for the general domains, and of course governments for the two-letter country code domains (although those governments in turn often contract out the management of their domains to businesses).</p>
    <p>Allocation of IP addresses, another ICANN responsibility, has been contracted out to five Regional Internet Registries, roughly one per continent. The one for North America is the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN). The regional registries allocate blocks of addresses to Internet Service Providers.</p>
  </div>
<div class="takeNote">
    <p>The Internet Society (ISOC) is a worldwide nonprofit membership society that anyone can join, for free. (Want to be in charge of the Internet? That's how.) It grew out of the IETF, which is an informal group with no official legal status. ISOC is a nonprofit corporation; you can contribute money to it. It is now officially in charge of IETF, and also conducts education and promotes government policies supporting an open Internet.</p></div>
<p>Other countries have never been happy about the US control of the Internet.  For example, until 2009 all DNS domain names had to use the English alphabet, despite constant requests to accommodate other languages. 2009 was also the year of a large international meeting whose goal was to internationalize Internet governance, but the US didn't cooperate.    
    <p>The issue of US control has become much more heated since Edward Snowden's exposure of very extensive spying on Internet traffic by the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013. It's too soon to know how these concerns will eventually be resolved.
