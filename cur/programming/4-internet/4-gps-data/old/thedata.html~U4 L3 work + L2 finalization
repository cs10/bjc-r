        <p>
            The data given to you are GPS coordinates that determine locations. In particular, the format that is given is that of <span style="font-style: italic;">Decimal Degrees</span>:<br />
            <strong><font size="4">DDD.DDDDD&deg; (latitude), </font></strong><br />
            <strong><font size="4">DDD.DDDDD&deg; (longitude) </font></strong><br />
            <strong><font size="4">for example 37.869000 -122.272999</font></strong>
        </p>
        <p>This is the format you'll find most computer based mapping systems displaying. The coordinates are stored internally in a floating point data type, and no additional work is required to print them as a floating point number. Positive values of latitude are north of the equator, negative values to the south. Watch the sign on the longitude, most programs use negative values for west longitude. This saves a lazy western hemisphere programmer from having to type in a minus sign before most of their longitude values. ;-)</p>
        <p>It's not necessary for you to know more than that for continuing with the lab, but if you are interested, read the following quick introduction on how GPS coordinates work: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2209240_read-gps-coordinates.html">E-How Tutorial on GPS coordinates</a>. In anyways, go ahead and post the above coordinates into <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> to find out where they point to!</p>
