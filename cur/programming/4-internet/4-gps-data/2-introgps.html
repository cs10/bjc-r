<p>Let's take a closer look at the first GPS coordinates in the file. The coordinates are (40.8,-73.94). GPS coordinates describe a location on Earth by a <strong>latitude</strong> (north-south) and a <strong>longitude</strong> (east-west).	<div class="sidenoteBig">It's not necessary, but if you are interested, read this or another quick introduction on GPS coordinates: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2209240_read-gps-coordinates.html">E-How Tutorial on GPS coordinates</a>. And/or, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQdIjwoi-u4" target="_blank">video on GPS &amp; Relativity</a>.</div></p>


        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
		<ol>
		<li>The pair (40.8, -73.94) gives a location in New York City. Is the latitude 40.8 north or south? North or south of what?</li>
		<li>The longitude -73.94 indicates New York City is <em>west</em> of longitude 0. How might the longitude of Chicago compare to this number? </li>		
		</ol>
		</div>

        <p>In each coordinate pair, the first number is the <em>latitude</em> (north-south), and the second number is the <em>longitude</em> (east-west).</p>

    	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/Latitude_and_Longitude_of_the_Earth.svg" alt="Latitude and Longitude of the Earth" title="Latitude and Longitude of the Earth" />
        <div class="endnote"> Positive values of latitude are north of the Equator, negative values are south. Positive values of longitude are east of the Prime Meridian (through London), negative values are west. </div>
        <p>For example, if you <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/40%C2%B044'55.7%22N+73%C2%B059'07.5%22W/@40.7488051,-73.9854167,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0" target="_blank">search for "40.7488051,-73.9854167" in Google Maps</a> (or Google Earth), you'll see the corresponding location, near the Empire State Building.</p>
        <div class="todo">Include a 2D map of that locaton with lat and long clearly marked to make it clear WHY we reverse the order. --MF</div>

        <div class="takeNote"> Note when <em>writing</em> GPS coordinates, the convention is that the first number is <em>latitude</em>, the north-south measurement, and the second, <em>longitude</em>, is measures east-west. $$latitude, longitude$$ $$40.7488051,-73.9854167$$ However, when <em>plotting</em> GPS coordinates, the convention is that <em>longitude</em>, which is plotted on the horizontal <em>x</em>-axis, is first, and <em>latitude</em>, which is measures vertical location on the <em>y</em>-axis is second. $$(longitude, latitude)$$  $$(-73.9854167, 40.7488051) $$ When plotting GPS coordinates, plot them as (longitude, latitude), reversing the written order.</div>

    <h3>Making the data useful</h3>
    
    <div class="comment">*need to build this, think about whether to switch lat and long now, think about whether the data-read-in is relevant*</div>
    <p>
    	GPS data isn't very useful as a list of numbers; the data is far more useful if we can <em>visualize</em> it. Here are the coordinates as a list of lists: <br />
    	<a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/U3Lab5GPS.xml"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/gps_coords.png" alt="set (coordinates) to {{37.869050, -122.272050}, etc}" title="set (coordinates) to {{37.869050, -122.272050}, etc}" /></a><br />
    	When you open the project, you will see that the background of the stage is set to an <em>x</em>-<em>y</em> grid and that the sprite's costume is a black circle.
    </p>
    
    <div class="forYouToDo">
        <ol>
            <li>
                Write a script to plot the coordinates on the graph. Use <code>stamp</code> to plot the points.<br />
                When you run your script, you should see this (need to fix this):
                <div class="sidenote">Remember, plot the longitude first, then the latitude.</div>
            	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/gps_badpic.png" alt="graph with only one point around (37, -122)" title="graph with only one point around (37, -122)" />
        	</li>
            <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Why can't you see all the points?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Transform the data</h3>
    <div class="sidenoteBig">You can do it your own way instead if you like.</div>    
    To display all the points, you'll need to <em>transform</em> them. These problems will lead you through one way to do this.
    
    <div class="forYouToDo">
    <ol start="2">
      <div class="sidenote">Subtracting -74 is the same as adding 74.</div>
      <li>Every point's longitude is around -74 and every point's latitude is around 40. This does not help us tell the points apart. Subtract -74 from every <em>x</em>-coordinate and subtract 40 from every <em>y</em>-coordinate, <strong>using a <a href="">higher-order function</a></strong>.</li>
      <li>Now the first <em>x</em>-coordinate is BLAH. There are many choices we could make to turn this into a "nicer" number. One choice is to multiply every <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-coordinate by BLAH. Adjust your higher-order function to do this calculation as well.</li>
      
      <div class="sidenoteBig">Making Snap<em>!</em> do the work is better, because then the program can be used on <em>any</em> set of GPS points in this area, and not just these. That's abstraction.</div>
      <div class="sidenoteBig">Recall that you made a block called <code>average</code> in <a href="http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-list-operations/combine.html">Lab 2 ("Combine with")</a>.</div>
      <li>Now the first <em>x</em>-coordinate is BLAH, which we still can't see on the grid. Let's center the coordinates around the <em>average</em> <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-coordinate. Subtract the average of all the <em>x</em> values from each of the <em>x</em>-coordinates, and subtract the average of all the&nbsp;<em>y</em> values from each of the <em>y</em>-coordinates. Make Snap<em>!</em> do the work.</li>
      <li>Once you have these transformed coordinates, use your script from problem 1 to plot the points.</li>
    </ol>
