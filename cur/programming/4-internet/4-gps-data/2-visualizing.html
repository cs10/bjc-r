    	<h2>Visualizing Data</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <ol>
                <li>Any reason this can't be tacked onto the end of the previous page? This page is very short, and it would be helpful to have the actual coordinates on the same page. --MF</li>
                <li><strong>GH Feedback:</strong> I'm not sure what the case is, or what the students are being directed to do. What are examples of hypotheses they might have? What is the situation?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>Let's go to <span class="snap">Snap</span> and visualize the data.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <div class="comment">XML file should be moved to /prog/3-lists directory. --MF</div>
                <li>Use the <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/data/gps-digital-forensics.xml"> gps-digital-forensics starter project</a> to get started.  You'll see that the stage has a nice grid for a background image, and the sprite has a circle costume to stamp coordinates with.</li>
                <li>Now get the GPS coordinates into a <span class="snap">Snap</span> list. You'll need separate numbers for each longitude and latitude, so each element of your main list of data should be a list with two entries (one for each coordinate).</li>
                <li>There is an example script in the starter project that draws a dot at <code>50</code>, <code>50</code>.  Use your list of data to draw each coordinate on the screen.</li>
			</ol>
            
            <p><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />Now that you've visualized the data, discuss with your peers:</p>
            
            <ol start="4">
                <li>Do you have any hypotheses for the case?</li>
                <li>How could you test them?</li>
            </ol>
