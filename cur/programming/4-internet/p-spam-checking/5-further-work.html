                    <ul>
                        <li>Detect spam by finding phone numbers or web links</li>
                        <li>Detect spam by finding words that are highly frequent in spam messages and not in ham messages</li>
                        <li>Detect spam by checking with a dictionary for clean spelling and no abbreviations</li>
                        <li>Combine several methods</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>How hard would it be to implement your solutions?</li>
            	<li>Compare your solutions with the one you wrote earlier (using average number of words)?  Which would do better?  Why?</li>
            </ol>
