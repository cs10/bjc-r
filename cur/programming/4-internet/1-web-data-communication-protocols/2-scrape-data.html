        <h2>Scraping Data from Web Pages</h2>
        <div class="todo">What is the point of this page (from a students' perspective)? It seems arbitary to me. (I can see that it's introducing data scraping.) I'll try to think of some mini-projecty thing to do here, but please feel free to leave an idea... --MF</div>
        
        <div class="sidenote">Weather forecast sites change their pages from time to time, so we're going to start with a web site we control. We'll build these blocks in a weather app in Lab 2.</div>
        <p>The Internet is full of information that you can use in your programs.  For example, you could write an 
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/umbrella.png" alt="umbrella? predicate" title="umbrella? predicate" /> block that looks up the weather forecast for your location and tells you whether or not to carry an umbrella or a block that reports the current temperature for a certain location:<br /><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/current-temp-62.png" alt="current temperature in (New York) reporting 62" title="current temperature in (New York) reporting 62" /></p>
        <p> We want a list of all the available libraries of Snap<em>!</em> blocks.
                
        <div class="takeNote">
            <p><strong>Sometimes you're lucky,</strong> and a URL points directly to a data file:</p>
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/libraries-txt.png" alt="text from URL snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/libraries/LIBRARIES">

            <ol>
	            <li>If you don't already have it open, load your project "U4L1-Web" from the <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-web-data-communication-protocols/1-read-web.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">previous page</a>.</li>
                <li>
                    The reported value above is a multi-line text string.  Just as you did for <em>words</em> and <em>sentences</em> in Unit 3, in this unit you'll often find it more convenient to have a list with one <em>line</em> per item.  In your scripting area you should see this script:<br />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/libraries-txt-list.png" alt="split LIBRARIES by line"><br />
                    <div class="sidenote"><img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/drag-out.gif" width="75%" alt="animation of dragging out resize corner"></div>
                    Click on it, and pull out the bottom right corner of the stage watcher so that you can see the entire list.<br />
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Compare this list with the result in the speech balloon above.  What do you notice?</li>
                        <li>In the Snap<em>!</em> file menu, click on "Libraries..." and look at the submenu that appears.  Compare it with what's in the file.  Why do you think they're different?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Find the <code>split</code> block in the Operators palette, and experiment with the different options for the second input slot. Read the help screen (right-click on a <code>split</code> block and choose &quot;Help&quot;) if you need ideas.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        
        <div class="takeNote"><strong>When you're <em>not</em> lucky,</strong> the information you want is buried in a mass of HTML code.  Extracting the information from the formatting is called <em>scraping</em> the web page.</div>
        
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="3">
                <li>In a new browser tab, visit the page <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/libraries" target="new">http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/libraries</a>.  How does it compare with the ...libraries/LIBRARIES one?</li>
                <li>
                    In your Snap<em>!</em> window, click on this script:<br />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/libraries-dir-list.png" alt="split libraries by line"><br />
                    You're putting the result in a global variable only because there's a watcher for that variable on the stage, so it's easy to see the result.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We'd like to extract the list of files from this web page.  As a first step, use a higher order function to select only the list items that contain file names, rather than header text.  You'll find this block helpful:<br />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/contains.png" alt="( ) contains ( ) ?">

                    The <code>scrape</code> block in this project is an attempt to scrape just the file names from the <code>libraries</code> web page.  It almost works, but it has a couple of problems.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Read the code of <code>scrape</code> and make sure you understand how it works.  It uses helper blocks<br />
                            <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/substring-starting.png" alt="substring of ( ) starting ( )"><br />
                            <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/substring-upto.png" alt="substring of ( ) up to ( )"><br />
                            Notice the narrow input slot in the second of those; it's meant to let you know that only a single character goes there, not a multi-character string.  Experiment with these blocks.
                        </li>
                        <li>Fix the bugs in <code>scrape</code> so that you get a complete list of files and nothing else.</li>
                        <li>Try your <code>scrape</code> block on <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/Costumes" target="new">snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/Costumes</a> to make sure it can work on <em>any</em> file directory.
