<h2>A Weather Report</h2>
<p>Now you can query the National Weather Service for current temperature and weather conditions. Let's combine that with our work on lists to build a weather report for multiple cities.</p>

<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>Change the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/1-introduction-to-lists/1-shopping-list-app.html">shopping list app</a> so that you can type in a list of cities and states.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>The weather report should take a list of cities like this...

<img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/citieslist.png" width="20%" align="middle" alt="List of cities"></p>

<p>... and produce a report like this:

<img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/citiesreport.png" width="20%" align="middle" alt="Weather report for cities"></p>

<div class="forYouToDo"><ol start="2">
<li>If there were only one city in the list, what could you do to produce the report?</li>
<li>Use list operations to produce the weather report, then test it on other cities.</li>
<li>Build a visual weather report: take the list information and produce sentences, then <code>say</code> those sentences in the app.

<img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/boston62.png" width="20%" align="middle" alt="Spoken weather report"></li>

</ol></div>

<div class="takeItFurther">
<ol type="A">
<li>Modify the weather report so that it will also include the forecasted temperature and conditions for tomorrow.</li>

</ol></div>
