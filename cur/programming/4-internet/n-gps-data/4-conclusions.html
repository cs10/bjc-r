    	<h2>GPS Forensics: Drawing Conclusions</h2>
        <p>Eye-balling through your visualization is fine, but precise conclusions require more. So let's put it all together and find out how well your clustering did. The goal is to come up with a quality statement like: "<em>X</em> percent of the points lie within <em>Y</em> clusters." </p>
    	<p>Aiming at high values of <em>X</em> would provide evidence for the validation of our hypothesis&mdash;that is, most of the points should lie within a few clusters.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
    		<ol>
                <li>
                    Create a block that takes as an input:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the cluster data,</li>
                        <li> the clusters themselves, and</li>
                        <li> a distance</li>
                    </ul>
                    and returns how many points lie within in.<br />

                </li>
		        <div class="comment">Both of these images need alt and title attributes. Please put them in. -MF</div>
        		<li>
                	Once you have implemented this block, you can use it by extending the above code:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/fraction-of-list-of-lists-within-list-of-lists-extended.png" alt="" title="" />
                </li>
            </ol>
            Implement, experiment, and then discuss with your peers:<br />
            <ol start="3">
                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
                <li>How many clusters did you find? How many points did fit?</li>
                <li>Did you validate the multiple perpetrator hypothesis? If so, how many criminals need to be hunted?</li>
                <li>How sure are you of your conclusions? Are there other possible outcomes? If so, how could they be validated?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
