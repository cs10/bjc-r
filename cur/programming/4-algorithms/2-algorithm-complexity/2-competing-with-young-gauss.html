        <h2>Competing with Young Gauss</h2>
        <p>We would like to add all the numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>N</code>, where <code>N</code> could be a big number.  The obvious way to do this is to simply add them up, one by one.</p>

        <div class="comment">MF: Numbers are not code and should not have the &lt;code&gt; tag.</div>
        <p>We can, however, also follow in the footsteps of the young Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss, a now-revered 18th century mathematician. As the story goes, he was punished by his elementaryschool teacher to do the same exercise: add all the  numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>100</code>. The teacher, J. G. Büttner, assumed that the problem would take Gauss a long time to do, yet Gauss finished the problem in a matter of seconds. He realized that, adding <code>1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 100</code> was the same as  adding <code>(1 + 100) + (2 + 99) + (3 + 98) + ... + (50 + 51)</code>. Each pair summed up to <code>101</code>, and there were <code>50</code> of these pairs, so he quickly deduced that the  answer was &nbsp;<code>101 &times; 50 = 5050</code>. Presumably, teacher Büttner wasn't pleased.</p>
        <p class="alert quoteOrange">In general, if you wanted to add the numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>N</code>, the answer would be 
        $$(N + 1) \times (N ÷ 2)$$
        because there are <code>(N &divide; 2)</code> pairs, each of which add up to <code>(N + 1)</code>.</p>
        <p>Imagine that you are playing a game against young Gauss to see who could add numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>N</code> faster: he does it his way, while you manually add them one by one. You can either win, lose, or tie in this game. What do you think would happen if <code>N</code> is <code>2</code>? If <code>N</code> is <code>10</code>? If <code>N</code> is <code>100</code>? If <code>N</code> is one million?</p>
