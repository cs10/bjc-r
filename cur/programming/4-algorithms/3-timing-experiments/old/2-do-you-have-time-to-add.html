    	<h2>The Time It Takes to Increment</h2>
		<p>Let us start our timing experiments with something simple: how long does it take for a computer to <em>add 1 to</em> (that is, <em>increment</em>) a number?</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Replace "Hello!" in the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-algorithms/3-timing-experiments/1-time-is-of-the-es-sense.html" target="_blank">timing script</a> with an addition operator from the "Operators" palette, and add 1 to 100,000.</li>
                <li>Run the script a few times (around four) to get an idea of the average approximate time (in seconds) it takes for the computer to increment 100,000.</li>
                <li>Run the script repeatedly. (Do <em>not</em> place the script inside a <code>repeat</code> or a <code>repeat until</code> block, since we are interested in knowing the <em>approximate</em> time the script takes to run <em>once</em>.)</li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> What's your gut feeling for how much longer the computer would take if we doubled 100,000?</li>
                <li>
                    Test your intuition: Create a table of the an average approximate times for how long it takes the computer to increment (add 1 to) numbers that you progressively double:
                    <ul>
                        <li>100,000</li>
                        <li>200,000</li>
                        <li>400,000</li>
                        <li>800,000</li>
                        <li>1,600,000</li>
                    </ul>
                    Remember that for each number, you need to run the timing script multiple times (around four) to get an idea of the <em>average</em> approximate time (you don't have to be precise).
                </li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> What do you observe? </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="takeItFurther">
    		<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
            <ol type="A">
        		<li>
            		Take another huge leap and find out approximately how long it takes for the computer to increment numbers that you progressively scale by 10: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>160,000,000</li>
                        <li>1,600,000,000</li>
                        <li>16,000,000,000</li>
                    </ul>
                    What do you observe? How is this similar to or different from scaling by 2?
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
