        <p>For this section, we will be using <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/algorithms/timing-framework.xml">this timing script</a>. It is very similar to <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-algorithms/3-timing-experiments/1-time-is-of-the-es-sense.html" target="_blank">the script you constructed earlier</a>, but it also has the beginnings of a few blocks that we will be filling in. The first block that we will fill in is already on stage: </p>
        <div class="comment">Rebuild this image.</div>
        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/list/insert-all-numbers-block.png" title="Insert all numbers between 'start' and 'end' into 'list'" alt="Insert all numbers between 'start' and 'end' into 'list'" />
        <div class="todo">The following paragraph needs clarification. --MF</div>
        <p>This block should fill the input list with all of the numbers from start to end. If working correctly, the version used on stage should generate all of the numbers from 1 to <code>max</code>, where <code>max</code> is a number that we will change when running timing experiments, and should add them to the <code>numbers</code> list.
        </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Discuss an algorithm that you can use to fill the input list with all of the numbers from start to end. 
        </li>
                <li>Once you both have decided on an algorithm, complete the body of the block. </li>
                <li>Now, run the script with <code>max</code> set to 10. Run it a few times to get an idea of the average time the computer takes to generate this list (to the nearest tenth of a second&mdash;you don't need to be exact).</li>
                <li> 
                    Repeat the experiment with <code>max</code> set to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>20</li>
                        <li>40</li>
                        <li>100</li>
                        <li>200</li>

                    Do you see a pattern?
