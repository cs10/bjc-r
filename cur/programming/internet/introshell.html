            For the first part of this lab you will be using the terminal.
            However, you will not be using it to run code you have written or navigating directories. Instead you will be using the terminal to experimentally investigate properties of 
            the Internet. When you type commands into the terminal you are interacting with the  shell which is a program that processes your commands (like 'ls' and 'cd') and returns an output. Click on the image on the right to see a prominent featuring of a shell in a movie. Most parts of this lab require watching a short video, a small exercise, and discussing answers to posed questions. Please make sure to take the time to discuss high level concepts from the videos with your peers. There is no need to take extensive notes on the videos. 

            <!-- For the first part of this
            lab you are going to be using tools that a system
            administrator usually uses to diagnose network trouble,
            except we are going to use the tools to experimentally
            investigate the properties of the Internet. You might be
            surprised to read that no part of this lab will rely on
            Snap<em>!</em>  or any other programming. Instead, we are going to use
            the Linux shell. Click on the image on the right to see a
            prominent featuring of a shell in a movie. Most parts of
            this lab require discussion and answering questions. Please
            make sure to take the time and brainstorm with your peers.
            You can put the responses down on paper or use our <a

            The shell is a very powerful tool that takes decades
            to master. In this lab, we will therefore only glimpse at
            it. A simple, 10-minute introduction to the shell can
            be found here: <a href="http://youtu.be/T6pp82CVQfQ">Watch
              video now</a>. While you do not need any particular 
            command line skills in this lab, we recommend watching the
            video anyways to get an initial idea for typical shell
            usage beyond what you have experienced in the previous labs. <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A note: For this lab, we
              highly suggest refraining from the usage of the command</span><span
              style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> rm -rf</span><span
              style="font-weight: bold;">. It's highly powerful but
              can&nbsp; render entire computer systems unusable or brick
              tablets and cellphones easily. Every system administrator
              has his or her own story to tell.</span><br>
            <br>
            Start your own shell now by opening terminal just like you have for the 
            previous python labs. You can consult the videos below and go on to the next
            page. Note that this lab might not completely work under
            Windows.<br>
