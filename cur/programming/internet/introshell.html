            lab you are going to be using tools that a system
            administrator usually uses to diagnose network trouble,
            except we are going to use the tools to experimentally
            investigate the properties of the Internet. You might be
            surprised to read that no part of this lab will rely on
            Snap! or any other programming. Instead, we are going to use
            the Linux shell. Click on the image on the right to see a
            prominent featuring of a shell in a movie. Most parts of
            this lab require discussion and answering questions. Please
            make sure to take the time and brainstorm with your peers.
            You can put the responses down on paper or use our <a

            The Linux shell is a very powerful tool that takes decades
            to master. In this lab, we will therefore only glimpse at
            it. A simple, 10-minute introduction to the Linux shell can
            be found here: <a href="http://youtu.be/T6pp82CVQfQ">Watch
              video now</a>. While you do not need any particular Linux
            command line skills in this lab, we recommend watching the
            video anyways to get an initial idea for typical shell
            usage. <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A note: For this lab, we
              highly suggest refraining from the usage of the command</span><span
              style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> rm -rf</span><span
              style="font-weight: bold;">. It's highly powerful but
              can&nbsp; render entire computer systems unusable or brick
              tablets and cellphones easily. Every system administrator
              has his or her own story to tell.</span><br>

            Start your own shell now (possibly ask a lab assistant or TA
            for help) or consult the videos below and go on to the next
            page. Note that this lab might not completely work under
            Windows.<br>
