      There is another Snap! piece that lets us repeat things. It is called "repeat until". Just like REPEAT, it will do everything inside the C-shaped block a certain number of times. Except, before it starts the loop each time, it checks to see if the condition (below x &gt; 5) is true. If this is condition is true, then it will not repeat again. <br><br>

      <br>It can be really helpful to keep track of what the variable X is at each point to help us understand how this new piece works. <br>
      <ul>
         <li>In the right column we keep track of the value of x. </li>
         <li>In the diagram below we draw a horizontal line every time we start the loop. <br></li>
         <ul>
            <li>Here we labeled each line "Top of loop" and "Bottom of loop" but we could just use the horizontal line to keep track of this information. <br></li>
         </ul>
         <li>Within each loop the variable x increases by 1, so we write down the new value for x.</li>
      </ul>

      Try to use a chart like the one above to keep track of what happens in the complicated "repeat until" code below. <br><br>
