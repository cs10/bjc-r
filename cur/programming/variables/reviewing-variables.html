</head><body> The previous lab was aimed at getting you comfortable with using <strong>variables</strong> to store values and thus to do things you couldn't do before. Variables are one of the central concepts in computer science and one of the most powerful tools in a programmer's toolbox. They will pop up steadily throughout the rest of the semester. <br><br> These are two blocks that we will be seeing a <em>lot</em> in the coming months. Make sure that you are clear with the differences are between them. <br><br><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/set-vs-change.png" alt="Set and change" title="Set and change" ><br><br> As we mentioned in the last lab, you can use these two blocks to accomplish the same thing, but it probably makes more sense to use one over the other depending on what you are trying to do. <strong>If you are trying to set the value relative to what it already is</strong> (such as adding $$5 to a variable storing a bank balance), you will probably be better off using a <code>change</code> block. <strong>If you are trying to set it to a totally new, unrelated value</strong> (such as resetting someone's score in a video game), then you will probably want to use a <code>set</code> block.    </body></html>
