        <h3>How do search engines find the information you want?</h3>
        
        <p>There is a lot of information on the Internet, but the information is useless unless you have some way of finding what you're looking for. Imagine if there were no search engines. To find information, you would have to already know where to look. Search engines connect us to information, and they do it quickly.</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>In groups of 4, read <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=138" target="_blank"><em>Blown to Bits</em> pages 120-138</a>. Everyone should read "It Matters How It Works" on pages 120-121.<br />
                Then, split the rest of the sections among the group so that at least one person is reading each section.
                <ul>
                	<li>Step 1: Gather Information</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Keep Copies</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Build an Index</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Understand the Query</li>
                    <li>Step 5: Determine Relevance</li>
                    <li>Step 6: Determine Ranking</li>
                    <li>Step 7: Presenting Results</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>For each step, discuss in your group how that step works and how it affects what we see when we perform a search.</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="takeItFurther">
        	<ol type="A">
            	<li>How does what you learned today change how you think about search results?</li>
                <li>Are search engines biased? What are some of the biases that might show up in search results? What are some considerations computer programmers must think about as they design these search engines?</li>
                <li>Read the section "Search Results Can Be Manipulated" (<a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=166" target="_blank"><em>Blown to Bits</em> pages 148-151</a>) to learn about Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Do you think search engine optimization is fair play?</li>
                <li>Read the section "Search Control and Mind Control" (<a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=168" target="_blank"><em>Blown to Bits</em> pages 151-156</a>) to read about Google's decision to enter China. Do you think the government should be able to control what you see online?</li>
                <li>Of course search engines also raise the privacy concerns you studied in Unit 2. Read <a href="http://donttrack.us" target="new">donttrack.us</a> for a (self-serving, as you'll see, but worth reading anyway) short demonstration of the issue.</li>
