    	<h2>Design Your Own Search Engine</h2>
    	
        <h3>How would you improve search engines? Or, for what specific topic would you want a search engine?</h3>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        	Here are two ways to think about how you might contribute to search engine technology:
            <ol>
                <li>Think of an existing search engine, such as Google, Yahoo!, or Bing. Perform some searches on topics that interest you. Do they come up with helpful links? Do the links appear in an order that makes sense?
                  <ul>
                	<li>What kind of biases might be affecting the links and order they appear?</li>
                    <li>What are some news sources or websites you are familiar with that the search engine just seems to be missing?</li>
                    <li>Write some suggestions you would send to these large companies to improve their search engines. For example, you might suggest important sources of information they are missing. Or you might find that the search engine doesn't understand your search because it doesn't understand the phrasing you used.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>There are <a href="http://www.top10tag.com/ten-best-specialized-search-engines/" target="new">specialized search engines</a> that don't search the entire Internet, but do a very good job for a specific topic. Choose a topic you care about and describe how you would design a search engine for that topic. Think about the steps involved (e.g., building an index, determining relevance, displaying results) and describe how your search engine would work.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
