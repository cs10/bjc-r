        <h3>Drawing 3D Shapes</h3>
		<div class="todo">Lab1’s last page, draw shape, has lots of numbers, but we’re doing something with them.  If we used MAP over the vertices of A to translate it, or dilate it, that would be ok.  I actually thought that was here somewhere, but couldn’t find it.  That would require a slightly more complex “getting inside” the list operation, but the kids in their dialogue have already begun that thinking in draw shape.  But when we get to the page on MAP, it applies arbitrary functions to arbitrary numbers for no apparent reason other than exercise.</div>
		<div class="todo">Could you invent a MAP page that builds on draw shape, maybe translating or reflecting or dilating?  You could exchange x and y coords and see what happens.  A translation of, say, (20, 10) could look 3-D ish, especially if corners of the two were connected.  So would a connecting an image and a dilation. --PG</div>

In this case the function we want is &quot;join the letter 's' after the given word.&quot; When you drag the <code>join</code> block into the <code>map</code> input slot, the grey ring is still visible, to remind you that the input is a function, not the word that you'd get from some particular <code>join</code>ing.</p>

            <div>
            	<span>Alphie:</span> Well, I don't think the function has to be mathematical. We used <code>plural</code> with words. But let's try to put the function <em>f</em> in there. First I need to build <em>f</em>.  Here you go:<br />
            	<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/deff.png" alt="f(n)=3n+7" title="f(n)=3n+7"><br />

<div class="comment">JK: Comment from Dan and NY teachers: "They worked for quite a while, not realizing that if the function passed to map is “item _ of LIST” that they could remove the 1 to leave a blank slot.  This has come up before with students who see a drop-down menu and don’t realize it can be edited."</div>
        
        <li><strong>Make</strong> a red block, <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/lookup_block.png" alt="red reporter: lookup items () from ()" title="red reporter: lookup items () from ()" />. Here's how it starts:<br /> <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/lookup_block_def.png" alt="lookup items (item numbers) from (this list)" title="lookup items (item numbers) from (this list)" /><br />And here it is in action on our list <code>nouns</code>:<div class="sidenote">If you need some inspiration, look again at <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-list-operations/getting-started.html#fmap">problem 3 in the Getting Started</a> for this lab.</div><br /><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/nouns.png" alt="giraffe, elephant, pizza, etc." title="giraffe, elephant, pizza, etc." /> <br /> <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/lookup_result.png" alt="lookup items (1,2,5) from (nouns) = (giraffe, elephant, boy)" title="lookup items (1,2,5) from (nouns) = (giraffe, elephant, boy)" /></li>
        
        <li>Once you've made <code>lookup items () from ()</code>, go to the file menu <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File button"/> and choose "Export blocks...". This opens a window with all the imported tools and all your custom blocks. <strong>Uncheck</strong> all the blocks <strong>except</strong> your new <code>lookup</code> block. Choose "ok."<br /> You will see a new tab open with text. Save this as "lookup.xml" (go to your browser's File->Save Page As... or right-click on the page and Save As...). Save it to a folder or on your computer's desktop.<br />Now, you can use this block in other <span class="snap">snap</span> projects. Try it now. Open a new <span class="snap">snap</span> page. Then <strong>drag</strong> the "lookup.xml" file onto the <span class="snap">snap</span> page. The block should now be in your Variables palette.<br />You will use the <code>lookup</code> block again later in Unit 3 Lab 4.</li>
