                <li>BH: I don't like scripts like this, ones that prompt for the user to type something and then call a reporter with that as input.  This doesn't help students believe that reporters are perfectly good on their own.  Why can't the user just type the phrase into the acronym block?<br>
            [We need a way to separate philosophical questions that apply across the curriculum from local errors, and start writing something like Mary's style guide but at a higher level of abstraction, listing decisions we make about the overall tone of the curriculum, things like what a "new" project is and how we should say what that wants to say.]<br>
            Shouldn't we at least say that the important words are the capitalized ones?<br>
            And, again, instead of those ANSWER pictures at the bottom, just have a reporter-and-result picture of the actual acronym block.<br>
            PS  Will anyone younger than 50 get the "alligator" reference?</li>
                <li>JK response: I think students get lots of experience that reporters are perfectly good on their own - don't they? I thought this was providing some variation and just giving people experience with other ways to present information. I don't mind changing it, but I didn't want to redo all the images if I didn't have to...</li>

The goal of this page is to build a reporter that generates <em>acronyms</em>.  An acronym is a kind of code for a phrase.  It consists of the first letters of every capitalized word in the phrase.  For example, an acronym for the "University of Massachusetts at Lowell"  is "UML".   So,

<div class="forYouToDo">
  <ol>
      <li>
<!---                	Edit the block <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/acronym_phrase.png" title="acronym(phrase)" alt="acronym(phrase)"  />  --->
                    
 Create a reporter  that takes a phrase as input and reports its acronym, made from the first letters of the capitalized words.  It should work like this:
 
 <br> <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/acronym_BJC.png" title="Beauty and Joy of Computing: BJC" alt="Beauty and Joy of Computing: BJC"  />
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/acronym_NYC.png" title="New York City: NYC" alt="New York City: NYC"  /> 
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/acronym_TTY.png" title="Talk To You Later: TTY" alt="Talk To You Later: TTY"  /></li>
 </ol>
 </div>
 
 <div class="takeNote">
    

 
 <br> A few notes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You might find <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine with</code> useful.</li>
                        <li>There are many ways to turn a string like "Beauty and Joy of Computing" into a list of words. One way is to use this green block: <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/sentence_to_list.png" title="sentence->list()" alt="sentence->list()"  /> (pronounced "sentence to list").</li>
                     

   </ul>
                    
                    </div>
                 
        </div>

      This is the corrected version of <code>acronym</code> that checks for words starting with a capital letter. Isn't it beautiful? It does a complicated job, so there's a lot packed in there, but think how much worse it would be if we didn't have lists to help organize such tasks. You'd take the text string <code>phrase</code> and write a loop to go through it, character by character, looking for spaces as word separators. Then you'd have to build up the result string, adding one letter at a time.

    <p>
      With <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code>, you can operate on the items of a list <i>all at once.</i> You don't have to think, "Find the first letter of the first word and operate on it, then increase the loop index until you find a space, then skip over any extra spaces that might be next to it, then remember the position of the beginning of the second word" and so on. You can think, "give me the first letters of all the words."<br>
      <br>
      (Instead, all that ugliness about looking for spaces is hidden inside the <code>sentence-&gt;list</code> block, where everyone writing an application about sentences can use it without having to reinvent it. This is another example of <i>abstraction,</i> which we mentioned right at the beginning as one of the central ideas of the course and of computer science in general.)
