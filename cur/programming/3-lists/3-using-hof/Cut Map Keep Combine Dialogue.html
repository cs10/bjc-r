            	<li>BH: ...just starting with the Unicode example would be okay, although really we should have, as Paul always says, a problem that kids will want to solve and /then/ talk about how to combine HOFs to solve it.</li>

            <div class="sidenoteBig">Click to review: <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-list-operations/2-map.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment"><code>map</code></a>, <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-list-operations/3-keep.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment"><code>keep</code></a>, or <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-list-operations/4-combine.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment"><code>combine with</code></a>.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> The <code>map</code> block applies some function to each item of a list.</div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> The <code>keep</code> block lets you choose some items from a list and not others.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> And <code>combine with</code> takes an operation (like <code>+</code>) and a list.  It combines all the items of the list into a single output using the operation. So, with <code>+</code>, it would give the sum of all the numebrs in the list.</div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> Would we ever use all three of the functions together?</div>

            <div><span>Alphie:</span> I guess you could start with a list of numbers, <code>keep</code> the ones that were greater than 50, use <code>map</code> to add 10 to all of them, and then use <code>combine with</code> to add those new numbers up.</div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> OK, let's try it. I'm just going to make up a variable called "list of numbers". Then we'll <code>keep</code> the numbers over 50.</div>
				<div class="stagedir">Betty builds this expression: <img border="0" title="keep(()>50)from(listofNumbers)" alt="keep(()>50)from(listofNumbers)" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/keep_listofNum.png" /></div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Then we add 10 to every item using <code>map</code>. And the list we're mapping over is everything over 50 that we kept, so let's just drag everything in our <code>keep</code> expression in there.</div>
				<div class="stagedir">Alphie builds this expression using Betty's: <img border="0" title="map(()+10)over(keep...)" alt="map(()+10)over(keep...)" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/keep_map.png" /></div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> Your last idea was to add all these new numbers up, right? So we'll use <code>combine with</code> and addition, and our list is everything in the <code>map</code> expression.</div>
