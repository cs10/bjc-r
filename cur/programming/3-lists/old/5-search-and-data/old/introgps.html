                        <p>For the first part of this lab you are going to be in a similar situation as a forensic analyst who works for a law enforcement agency. In other words, you will be doing the work of a computer forensic specialist as you might have seen on any of the popular TV series like CSI, NCIS, or similar. The author of this lab likes the character Abby from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCIS_%28TV_series%29" target="_blank">NCIS</a> :-)</p>
                        <p>Here is 	your case:&nbsp; In a kidnapping case, the criminal got away with the ransom even though the handover had been planned out very well by your colleagues. They thought it would have been a sure thing.&nbsp; Angry and frustrated, your NCIS field colleagues come back to you with a set of GPS coordinates that have been included in the Twitter messages that the kidnapper used to communicate with them during "negotation". They want you to reconstruct the movements of the perpetrator.</p>
                        <p>Here are the coordinates:<br />

                        </p>
                        <p>You will use exactly these coordinates through the remainder of part I of the lab. </p>
