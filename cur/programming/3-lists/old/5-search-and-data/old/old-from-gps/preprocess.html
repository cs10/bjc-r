      <p>
    In subsequent steps of this lab, we will ask you to visualize and
    work with the data in <span class="snap">Snap</span>. In general, 
    there is no standard solution to
    do this: it's different for every data set. 
    With this GPS data, we recommend
    to perform two steps of what's typically
    called <i>pre-processing</i>, or <i>cleaning your dataset</i>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Remove "redundant" values, i.e. get rid of information that
        doesn't make any difference.</li>
      <li>Center the coordinates so they can be visualized in an x/y-coordinate 
        system. Data can be easily centered by subtracting
        the mean of the data from all data points. <br />
      </li>
    </ol>
  <p>
    Here is an example:</p>
    <p class="alert quoteBlue">
    The values 123102, 123103, 123104 are only differ in the last digits, so they can be reduced to: 2, 3, 4.
    </p>
    <p class="alert quoteBlue">
    For visualization, we can center (or "normalize") them by subtracting the mean (which is 3) from each value. The result is: -1, 0, 1.    
</p>
<p>
    While you could do this in <span class="snap">Snap</span>, 
    using a text editor and a simple
    calculator is probably an easier choice. So before you move on to
    the next step, generate a text file that contains the interesting
    part of the coordinates, centered, line-by-line.
