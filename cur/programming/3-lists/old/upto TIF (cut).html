        <div class="comment">JK: LOTS of comments from Dan and NY teachers: "upto(n), when they’re trying to start with an empty list, and add the numbers 1-n to the list in order, they didn’t realize you could click left on the default list constructor to make it a function of no arguments.  I also mentioned yesterday that they were frustrated that nothing in the lab suggested they should look in the “Variables” tab for the “Add _ to (LIST)” block, since they are only shown list reporters above."</div>
        <div class="comment">JK: The previous comment concerned me because I was avoiding list mutation blocks in Unit 3 but it appears they were using them for this problem in NY. Al says this can be done using map, but I haven't figured it out yet...</div>
        <div class="comment">JK: From Dan: "I find a lot of the understanding the teachers have at this point for basic algorithms to be very “brittle”. They’ll get UpTo(n) using for (most of the times with help) but have NO idea how to do it using repeat or repeat until.  So I made sure everyone did it at least another way and then we showed all three solutions and talked about when you’d use which technique."</div>
        <div class="comment">From Github: "The "Take It Further" upto block is confusingly named. We want the output of the block to be a countdown, not a counting UP. No matter what is happening inside the actual program, the output is counting DOWN to one, like a spaceship liftoff."</div>
        <div class="comment">From Github: "The take it further Challenge is not specific enough. For example it should explain that users can input any possible integer."</div>
        <div class="comment">From Dan in NY: "• Many are bothered that upto(n) provides NO help:
        — hint or some suggestion that they should use/play with list blocks
        – hint that they should click the left arrow of the list block
• I encouraged them to look under the hood of how for worked, then change it to include a step, then use it to write upto(n)by(step)"</div>

                    Make a block <code>upto (n)</code> that takes a positive integer <em>n</em> as input and reports the list of integers from <em>n</em> to 1.
