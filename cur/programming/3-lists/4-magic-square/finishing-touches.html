        <div class="todo">
            <ul>
                <li>BH: #4 is way underspecified.  As an earlier example pointed out, they could just make a list of nine copies 1/3 of the target sum.  Is that an okay solution?  Or are the numbers supposed to be all different?  Etc.</li>
                <li>JK response: Didn't address this comment yet. First of all, I think the student can probably decide how complicated to make it - sure, they could make a square with all of the same number, but that's not terribly challenging (unless they're actually playing with how best to display it on the screen or something, which could be where they choose to go with this). Also, there are lots of really involved problems in this take it further... I kept it as Bowen wrote it for now, but perhaps some of these problems belong elsewhere?</li>

<!--  <p>Here's one way to build the <code>all-triples</code> reporter, using the <code>lookup</code> block created previously:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/all_triples_2.png" alt="code for all-triples reporter"></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>On the last page, you were asked to write a description of how to take the information from <code>all-triples</code> and determine whether or not the numbers form a magic square.</p>

  <p>Here is some help as you write the final code for the magic square predicate:</p> <p align="middle"><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/magicsquare.png" alt="Magic Square Checker" align="middle"></p>
  <ul>
  	<li> The <code>combine</code> block takes a two-input function and a list, and returns the result of performing that operation on all values of a list.</li>
      <p align="middle"><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine_with.png" alt="Combine With block" align="middle"></p>

  	<li> The <code>keep</code> block takes a predicate function as input, returning all values of a list that pass a condition.</li>
      <p align="middle"><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/keep_block.png" alt="Keep block" align="middle"></p>
  	<li> The <code>length of</code> block can tell you how many things are in a list.</li>
      <p align="middle"><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/length_block.png" alt="Length block" align="middle"></p>
</ul>
  <p><i> There is more than one good way to write this code!</i> Good luck.</p>


<ol> <i>When you finish, here are some challenges to try:</i>
  <li> Build a magic-square checker for 2-by-2 squares. </li>
  <li> ... for 4-by-4 squares. </li>
  <li> <b>Take It Further</b> ... for <i>n</i>-by-<i>n</i> squares.</li>
  <li> Build a magic-square <i>generator</i> given a target sum as input.</li>
  <li> <b>Take It Further</b> Find a 3-by-3 magic square made up entirely of prime numbers.</li>
