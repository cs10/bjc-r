    	<h2>GPS Forensics: Clustering</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <ul>
                <li>This page looks pretty different from the updated, EDC look, and it's content is different enough from the structure of contents on other pages that I hesitate to do it myself just yet. --MF</li>
                <li>GH feedback 8/12: I was looking for the comment in the code about adding the pre-processed coordinate list. I don't see the comment, and I am not sure where to add the list. It looks like we just choose 3 points at a time. Also, where is it explained about how to put the data into a text editor? Maybe a link here back to that explanation would be helpful for students (and me!). We need to keep in mind the number of ELL students and students with IEPs that are reading this, and define more words as we go along.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Suddenly, your crime-fighter colleagues come in and have a hunch: Maybe there was more than one perpetrator? The messages were collected in a very short time and no major movement was observed. So they ask you to confirm or deny the hypothesis that the messages come from more than one source and if so from how many.</p>
        <p>Clearly, all coordinates have different values.  So we have to find out if certain points are closer to other points and if that's a pattern. In other words:</p>
        <p>Can we group the points into distinct <em>clusters</em>?</p>
        <p>How many clusters are best?  It wouldn't add much information if each point was in its own cluster, or if we grouped all of them into a single large cluster.</p>
        <p>
            In order to do clustering, we need two main processes:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>A method to how close points are to each other. This is called a distance metric.  An easy to use metric is the Euclidean Distance <code>d</code>, which is accurate for <i>XY</i> coordinates on flat surfaces (as a disclaimer, GPS coordiates are not used on a flat surface&mdash;i.e., the Earth!  But, for coordinates all in a small area, Euclidean distance does good enough).</p>
                    <p>
                    	Given two points <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>, each with coordinates <code>p1<sub>lat</sub></code> and <code>p1<sub>long</sub></code> and <code>p2<sub>lat</sub></code> and <code>p2<sub>long</sub></code>, the euclidean distance is given as<br />

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A method to determine if a point belongs to a cluster or not. A cluster is a set of points, and we'll use our distance metric to compare the point in question (lets call it <code>p1<sub>outside?</sub></code>) with the points that are in the cluster. That will give you a list of distances (as many as there are points in the cluster), so you'll need to use that list to figure out if <code>p1<sub>outside?</sub></code> should be considered a member of the cluster.</p>
                    <p>You can do this in various ways; let's choose an easy one: figure out if the minimum distance in your list is less than some predetermined value. What this means, then, is that <code>p1<sub>outside?</sub></code> belongs to a cluster if the distance between it and the closet point in the cluster is "close enough".</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        	In Snap<em>!</em>, you'll make a block for each of these processes.these two blocks should look like this, once you have implemented them:<br />
        	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/data/distance-1-2-to-4-6.png" alt="'distance from (1,2) to (4,6)' showing 5" /><br />
			and<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/data/distance-1-2-to-cluster.png" alt="distance from (1,2) to cluster ((4,6), (40,60)) showing 5" />
       	</p>
      
		<p>Before you use your two new blocks, let's first take a look at the data by extending the previously introduced (<a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/data/clustering.xml">visualization code</a>):</p>
        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/data/clustering-visualization.png" alt="visualizing clusters">
        <p>As the comments already indicate, you need to add the pre-processed coordinates as lists (points) of lists (coordinates). If you followed the recommendation under pre-processing, you have these in a text editor and need to copy and paste them into the CLUSTER DATA list. In the next line, we start by defining three cluster center points that we eye-balled from the data. Then, in the following line, we set our minimum distance for a point belonging to a cluster to 50.</p>
        <p>Play around with the numbers to see if you can find better clusters. How many clusters do you feel are optimal and what are their parameters?</p>
