    <p>In this part of the lab, you are given a set of 500 real text messages that were part of a collection recorded and collected by T. Almeida and J. Hidalgo (<a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection">original source</a>). Download the <a href="hamspam500.txt">file here</a>. The text massages are in a text file line by line with words separated by spaces. The first word of each line is either "spam" or "ham" denoting the so-called ground truth classification by human annotators. Be aware that this is real-world data with very casual langauge.</p>
    <p>
        Two typical lines look like this:<br />
        <span style="font-style: italic;">ham&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair enough, anything going on?</span><br />
        <span style="font-style: italic;">spam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SMS. ac Sptv: The New Jersey Devils and the Detroit Red Wings play Ice Hockey. Correct or Incorrect? End? Reply END SPTV</span>
    </p>
    <p>The easiest way to load the file into SNAP is to import it into variable. To work with the messages, make use of the split function to split the file line-by-line into messages and another split function to split the messages&nbsp; into words using the spaces, taking into account that the first word gives the classification. </p>
