            	<div class="comment">Perhaps go in and edit the powerpoint itself to get rid of, for example, "(Cal)Clicker". Dan provides b/w as well as ppt files as well - perhaps for teachers?</div>
                <a href="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/2015Sp-CS10-L21-DG-Data_amount.pdf">Slides from UC Berkeley</a>
                <div class="sidenote">Vocabulary: bit, Byte, KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB</div>

        Data & Search
   	EK3.1.1A Computers are used in an iterative and interactive way when processing digital information to gain insight and knowledge.
   	EK3.1.1B Digital information can be filtered and cleaned by using computers to process information.
   	EK3.1.1C Combining data sources, clustering data, and data classification are part of the process of using computers to process information.
   	EK3.1.1D Insight and knowledge can be obtained from translating and transforming digitally represented information.
   	EK3.1.1E Patterns can emerge when data is transformed using computational tools.
   	EK3.1.2A Collaboration is an important part of solving data-driven problems.
   	EK3.1.2D Collaboration in developing hypotheses and questions, and in testing hypotheses and answering questions, about data helps participants gain insight and knowledge.

   	EK3.1.2F Investigating large data sets collaboratively can lead to insight and knowledge not obtained when working alone.
   	EK3.1.3A Visualization tools and software can communicate information about data.
   	EK3.1.3B Tables, diagrams, and textual displays can be used in communicating insight and knowledge gained from data.
   	EK3.1.3C Summaries of data analyzed computationally can be effective in communicating insight and knowledge gained from digitally represented information.
   	EK3.1.3D Transforming information can be effective in communicating knowledge gained from data.
   	EK3.1.3E Interactivity with data is an aspect of communicating.
   	EK3.2.1A Large data sets provide opportunities and challenges for extracting information and knowledge.
   	EK3.2.1B Large data sets provide opportunities for identifying trends, making connections in data, and solving problems.
   	EK3.2.1C Computing tools facilitate the discovery of connections in information within large data sets.
   	EK3.2.1D Search tools are essential for efficiently finding information.
   	EK3.2.1E Information filtering systems are important tools for finding information and recognizing patterns in the information.
   	EK3.2.1F Software tools, including spreadsheets and databases, help to efficiently organize and find trends in information.
   	EK3.2.1G Metadata is data about data.
   	EK3.2.1H Metadata can be descriptive data about an image, a Web page, or other complex objects.
   	EK3.2.1I Metadata can increase the effective use of data or data sets by providing additional information about various aspects of that data.
   	EK3.2.2A Large data sets include data such as transactions, measurements, texts, sounds, images, and videos.
   	EK3.2.2B The storing, processing, and curating of large data sets is challenging.
   	EK3.2.2C Structuring large data sets for analysis can be challenging.
   	EK3.2.2E Scalability of systems is an important consideration when data sets are large.
   	EK3.2.2F The size or scale of a system that stores data affects how that data set is used.
   	EK3.2.2G The effective use of large data sets requires computational solutions.
   	EK3.2.2H Analytical techniques to store, manage, transmit, and process data sets change as the size of data sets scale.
   	EK3.3.1A Digital data representations involve trade-offs related to storage, security, and privacy concerns.
   	EK3.3.1G Data is stored in many formats depending on its characteristics (e.g., size and intended use).
   	EK3.3.1H The choice of storage media affects both the methods and costs of manipulating the data it contains.
   	EK3.3.1I Reading data and updating data have different storage requirements.
   	EK4.2.4H Linear search can be used when searching for an item in any list; binary search can be used only when the list is sorted.
