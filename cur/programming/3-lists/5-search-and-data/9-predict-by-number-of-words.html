        <p>Now that you know that the average length differs,  build a simple classifier based on the number of words in a particular message.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                	Write a block that takes in a message and, based on how many words it contains, returns either "ham" or "spam" as its classification.<br />

                    	Implement in Snap<em>!</em>, and use it to classify the messages in our data.  You can use a regular loop to call your classify on the second item in each row of the data, or you might use this <i>faster</i> method using <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="the keep block">:<br />

                <li>Play around with different <i>threshold values</i>&mdash;that is, the number of words above which you decide that a message is spam.</li>
