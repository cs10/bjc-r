    	<h2>Big Questions</h2>
        
        <h3>How much information is out there?</h3>
        <ul>
        	<li>
                <div class="sidenote">Vocabulary: bit, Byte, KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB</div>
            	<div class="comment">Perhaps go in and edit the powerpoint itself to get rid of, for example, "(Cal)Clicker". Dan provides b/w as well as ppt files as well - perhaps for teachers?</div>
                <a href="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/2015Sp-CS10-L21-DG-Data_amount.pdf">Slides from UC Berkeley</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/02/17/man-made-dna-can-now-store-data-for-millions-of-years/">Man-made DNA can now store data for millions of years</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>What kind of information is out there?</h3>
        <ul>
        	<li>
            	<a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~zaiane/courses/cmput690/notes/Chapter1/ch1.pdf">Pages 1-3 of this article about data mining</a> The article goes on to describe the processes invovled in data mining, the kinds of data that can be mined, and the kind of information that can be discovered from data mining.
            </li>
            <li>Discuss: What opportunities are provided by large data sets?</li>
            <li>Discuss: What challenges are presented by them?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>How do Internet search engines work?</h3>
        <ul>
        	<li><em>Search is a new form of control over information</em> (p. 111). Read "It Matters How It Works" on <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter4.pdf">pages 120-121 in Chapter 4 of Blown to Bits</a>. More details about each of the 7 steps follow in the chapter.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>How do we access the data we want? How do we use computers to transform data into useful information?</h3>
        <ul>
        	<li><strong>GPS Forensics</strong> will give you experience with looking for patterns in data.</li>
            <li>In <strong>Weather App</strong>, you will pull and display data from an online database.</li>
            <li><strong>Spam and Ham</strong> is an <em>optional</em> lab in which you use a dataset to help you make decisions about the criteria you might use to build a spam filter.</li>
        </ul>

        Data & Search
   	EK3.1.1A Computers are used in an iterative and interactive way when processing digital information to gain insight and knowledge.
   	EK3.1.1B Digital information can be filtered and cleaned by using computers to process information.
   	EK3.1.1C Combining data sources, clustering data, and data classification are part of the process of using computers to process information.

   	EK3.1.3A Visualization tools and software can communicate information about data.
   	EK3.1.3B Tables, diagrams, and textual displays can be used in communicating insight and knowledge gained from data.
   	EK3.1.3C Summaries of data analyzed computationally can be effective in communicating insight and knowledge gained from digitally represented information.
   	EK3.1.3D Transforming information can be effective in communicating knowledge gained from data.
   	EK3.1.3E Interactivity with data is an aspect of communicating.
   	EK3.2.1A Large data sets provide opportunities and challenges for extracting information and knowledge.
   	EK3.2.1B Large data sets provide opportunities for identifying trends, making connections in data, and solving problems.
