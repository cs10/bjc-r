        <h2>The <code>For Each</code> Block</h2>
        
        <div class="dialogue"> <a name="seta" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>
            	<div class="stagedir">
                	Alphie and Betsy are making a list of coordinates for a sprite to make this drawing:<br />
            		<img border="2" class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/drawA.gif" alt="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" title="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" />
                </div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Let's use a list of lists to hold <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-coordinates for the letter A.</div>
				<div class="stagedir">Betsy clicks "Make a variable," names it "A," and builds: <img  src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/A.png" alt="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" title="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" /></div>
            <div>
            	<span>Alphie:</span> So, for each of the eight lists, we want to make the sprite go to (item 1, item 2). Here's how I would start it....
                <div class="stagedir">Alphie makes <img  src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/A_foreach.png" alt="script with for each (item) of (A) {glide 1 secs to x:(blank) y:(blank)} then glide to (0, 0)" title="script with for each (item) of (A) {glide 1 secs to x:(blank) y:(blank)} then glide to (0, 0)" /></div>
            	But what goes in the blanks after <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>?
            </div>
                
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Hmm... Good question. Also, this script isn't quite right. We don't want the pen down as it goes from wherever the sprite starts to the first point on the letter. And it won't connect the first and last points together. </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        	<ol>
            	<li>Load and finish building <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/U3L1-DrawShape.xml">Alphie's script</a>, and fix the two bugs Betsy noticed.</li>
                <div class="endnote">
                	Your script should:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have the correct inputs to the <code>glide</code> blocks so the sprite glides to each item on the list</li>
                        <li>Only have the <code>pen down</code> when connecting two points</li>
                        <li>Connect the first and last points</li>
                    </ul>

            <ol type="A">
				<li>Update the script so that it completes a drawing of the letter A. (Choose the additional coordinates yourself.)</li>
