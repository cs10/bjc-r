                    Can you fix these with an example in which we have a sensible (not arbitrary) collection and want to filter it to keep only certain items?
                    <ul>
                        <li>We could make this about student class schedules or yeearbook data (like <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/3-using-hof/1-processing-data-lists.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Lab 3: Processing Data in Lists</a>. --MF</li>
                        <li>Could this be rewritten about something interesting—like a DB/mail merge? Printing for School yearbook: Full name uses <code>combine</code> with <code>join words</code>), years in varyous activities, expected date of graduation -2015 (<code>map</code>) is number of years in new building, <code>keep</code> only students studying computer science, etc?  Then it would start out the unit <strong>followed by a few related problems</strong>. THEN the composing pages (perhaps combined, perhaps separatedly)--MF</li>
                        <li>Make a data type <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/yearbook-record-datatype.png" alt="ID: () First: () Last: () Year: () Extra Curriculars: () () ()" title="ID: () First: () Last: () Year: () Extra Curriculars: () () ()" /></li> 
                        <li>Create a birth year variable and have students create an average block using combine. they can map birth yeras to ages, find the avergage age, and find the age in certain grades or in certain extracurriculuar activities.</li>
                        <li>Many email servers have rules for creating new email accounts according to the user's name. For example, depending on the system, the name Jamal Reynolds might become jreynolds@emaildomain.com, reynoldsj@emaildomain.com, jamal.reynolds@emaildomain.com. Create an <code>email from names</code> reporter that takes first and last names as input and outputs an address that matches the format of your school email accounts.</li>

                        <div class="comment">We need more with split in general... --MF</div>
                        <li>Create a <code>names from email</code> reporter that accepts an email address (of one specific format) as input and outputs as much as can be determined about the user's name. For example, depening on the email format, jreynolds@emaildomain.com or reynoldsj@emaildomain.com would output "j. reynolds" and jamal.reynolds@emaildomain.com would output "jamal reynolds".</li>

        <p><code>Map</code> applies some function to each item of a list and reports the new list. <code>Keep</code> reports some items from a list and not others acording to a rule. <code>Combine</code> takes an operation (for example, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/plus.png" alt="plus" title="plus" />) and a list, and it reports a single result (in this case, the sum of all items).</p>

            <ul>
                <li>U3L2 getting started:  problems 1-3 (with map above) are not super-exciting, but they’ll do.  I wish problems 4 and 5 (wtih keep below)  were more motivated, and perhaps preceded by something that did not also require the mathematics. These are raw, arbitrary lists of numbers, and an arbitrary thing to do with them, and no easy way to check why it reports what it does (unless one already understands)—no “semantics” as I often say. Kids have seen mod before, but it doesn’t seem obvious why we’re doing what we’re doing.</li>
                <li>Can you fix these with an example in which we have a sensible (not arbitrary) collection and want to filter it to keep only certain items?</li>
                <li>If we do use numbers, maybe apply keep to an arbitrary list of positive and negative (say from the earlier coordinates list?) to keep only positive or only negative or only greater than 10 or….  So that we’re not both learning keep and trying to re-process mod.</li>
                <li>Problem 5, given that both lists are numbers, is way too hard to interpret.  Whatever we get has too many ways to explain it.  It won’t be understood.   One of those lists needs to have a different feel from the other.  Again, not sure what to do.</li>
                <li>The TiF is also pretty arbitrary.  We’re getting some mathematical lesson in comparing iii and iv, but we’re not getting CS, and it’s not interesting.</li>

            <p>The grey ring means that the input should be a <i>function</i>. What we mean by this is basically the same thing as the <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)=3<i>x</i>+7 kind of function in algebra, except that it doesn't have to be a numeric function. In this case the function we want is &quot;join the letter 's' after the given word.&quot; When you drag the <code>join</code> block into the <code>map</code> input slot, the grey ring is still visible, to remind you that the input is a function, not the word that you'd get from some particular <code>join</code>ing.

            <p>Instead of using a variable, like the <i>x</i> in <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>), to represent the input to the function, we leave one of <code>join</code>'s input slots as an empty box. This is supposed to remind you of the notation 3&times;&#x2610;+7 (&quot;three times box plus seven&quot;) that you learned for functions in elementary school before you knew about variables.
