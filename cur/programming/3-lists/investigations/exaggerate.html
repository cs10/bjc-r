    	<h2>Exaggerate</h2>
      Write a reporter <code>exaggerate</code> that takes a sentence as input and reports an exaggerated version:
      <br />
      <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/exaggerate.png" alt="exaggerate (I had 6 really good potstickers for dinner.) -&gt; I had 12 really great potstickers for dinner." title="exaggerate (I had 6 really good potstickers for dinner.) -&gt; I had 12 really great potstickers for dinner.">
      <br />
      It should replace "good" with "great," "bad" with "terrible," "like" with "love," etc. And it should replace every number with twice the number.<br>
