		<p><code>Map</code> <em>performs a function</em> to each item in a list and outputs a <em>list</em>. <code>Keep</code> <em>filters</em> for specific items and outputs a <em>list</em>. <code>Combine</code> <em>performs a binary operation</em> (a function with two inputs) across all items in the set and outputs a <em>single result</em>. The three can be used together to execute more advanced functions.</p>

			<p>PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER: Now that you’re a map, keep and combine expert you’re ready to use map, keep, and combine to make a very useful function block: remove pattern. Remove pattern takes a string str and a pattern x and removes the the pattern x everywhere from str. For example. For example if str is the string abracadabra and your removal pattern x is the letter a, then remove pattern(abracadabra, a) = brcdbr.</p>
			<p>
            	Here is some pseudocode to help with this:
<pre>remove pattern( str, x )
script variables: tokens
set tokens to the result of split str using the pattern x 
set tokens to the result of keep tokens with length &gt; 0  {got rid of empty tokens}
report the result of join list on tokens   {join list is the combine based function that you created in problem 6}</pre>
			</p>
			<p>Make sure to leave an example in your script that shows your remove pattern function works.</p>

        <h3>Character Encoding</h3>

                	Character encoding.  Good.  It recalls stuff the kids did earlier (in U2?) but bumps it up a notch.  I’d bump it up one more notch.  Here’s a good place to <strong>map adding some number to every number in a list</strong>.  Take an input message, tear it into letter-sized chunks, get the unicode, add 1, reconstitute it as a string.  Do reverse to decode.  Good way also to anticipate something in U4.--PG

                </li>
				<li>
                	In addition to encoding/decoding as an application of map as partial anticipation of U4, I’d also suggest <strong>turning a string into a list of lists containing the characters (or their Unicode) and the order in which they appear in the original message</strong>.  The utility of that won’t be apparent now, but is a decent exercise.  It will be useful in U4 (but I would not say that now) for students ever to have tried to do such a thing. Right now, if there’s a way to make it more “motivated” and less arbitrary, please do, but I could be satisfied even with just treating it as an exercise. --PG

        <p><br />
  Suppose we want the squares of all the items of a list of numbers. That's a straightforward <code>map</code> problem:<br />
<img border="0" title="map (() * ()) over list" alt="map (() * ()) over list" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/mapsq.png"/>

<br /><br />
Now suppose instead that we want to select the odd numbers from a list of numbers. It's a little tricky figuring out how to tell if a number is odd, but apart from that it's a straightforward <code>keep</code> problem:<br />
<img border="0" title="keep items such that <(() mod (2)) = (1)> from list..." alt="keep items such that <(() mod (2)) = (1)> from list..." src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/keepodds.png"/>

<br /><br />
But what if we want the squares of the odd numbers? This is neither a simple <code>map</code> nor a simple <code>keep</code>, but combines aspects of both. And we can solve the problem by using the value reported by the <code>keep</code> as the list input to <code>map</code>:<br />
<img border="0" title="map square over keep odds from list" alt="map square over keep odds from list" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/sq-odds.png"/>

<br />
Don't be confused about which inputs do and don't have rings. It's the square <u>function</u> and the are-you-odd? <u>function</u> that we use as the first input to each higher order function. But, even though <code>keep</code> itself is a function, it's <i>the <u>list</u> reported by <code>keep </code></i>that we're using as the second input to <code>map</code>.
