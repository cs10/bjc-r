    	<h2>Magic Squares</h2>
        <div class="todo">FROM PAUL:  I would include magic squares as a follow-up, omitting the current FYtD page 1 problem 1, if it is possible to gamify it. As it stands, even at the end, the only thing it does is test to see whether a given list (where did that come from?) is a magic square.  Perhaps allowing people to rearrange a set of consecutive numbers 0-8 or 1-9 or 1, 3, 5, 7… to try to make a magic square would be fun. The interaction could be much like TTT.  Then the program checks to see if you’ve done it.  ??? --PG</div>
        <p>In this lab, you will write <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/isamagicsquare_block.png" alt="green predicate: is a magic square?" title="green predicate: is a magic square?" /> that reports whether or not a set of numbers forms a <em>magic square</em>. In a magic square, the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal must be equal.</p>
        <p> The data in this list: <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/square_12_13_14.png" alt="square_12,13,14,10,18,11,17,15,16" title="square_12,13,14,10,18,11,17,15,16"> corresponds to this 3-by-3 grid of numbers:<br /> <img class="indent" border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/magic_square.png" alt="square_12,13,14,10,18,11,17,15,16" title="square_12,13,14,10,18,11,17,15,16">

		<p>Now that you've had some experience deciding what makes something a magic square, it's time to write an algorithm.</p>

            <ol start="2">
                <li> <i>Using as much detail as possible</i>, you and your partner should <em>each</em> write down&mdash;in words, not in code&mdash;an algorithm that you can use to decide whether or not a list of 9 numbers forms a magic square.</li>
                <li> Exchange your algorithm with your partner. Follow your partner's algorithm on this list: <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/square_3_2_1.png" alt="square_3,2,1,1,3,2,2,1,3" title="square_3,2,1,1,3,2,2,1,3"></li>

            </ol>
        </div>

		<p>One of the things that will be useful when you write <code>is () a magic square? </code> is a reporter that picks off elements from a given list, like the first, fourth, and seventh element.</p>
 
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start = "5">
                <li>Write an expression that reports (as a list) the fourth element  of a given list.</li>

        <h3>Triples</h3>
       
		<p>There are several possible algorithms for checking to see if a list forms a magic square. Though the details might be different, your algorithm probably involved identifying three numbers at a time and adding them. Call these sets of three numbers "triples".</p>

<h2>Finishing Touches</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <ul>
			<li> BK: What is the standard for listing input in a block? I've seen "is __ a magic square" but also "triples in square ()" and "is a magic square" with no blank. Changing all instances to what I think is the preferred: <code>is () a magic square</code>.</li>
                <li>BH: #4 is way underspecified.  As an earlier example pointed out, they could just make a list of nine copies 1/3 of the target sum.  Is that an okay solution?  Or are the numbers supposed to be all different?  Etc.</li>
                <li>JK response: Didn't address this comment yet. First of all, I think the student can probably decide how complicated to make it - sure, they could make a square with all of the same number, but that's not terribly challenging (unless they're actually playing with how best to display it on the screen or something, which could be where they choose to go with this). Also, there are lots of really involved problems in this take it further... I kept it as Bowen wrote it for now, but perhaps some of these problems belong elsewhere?</li>
