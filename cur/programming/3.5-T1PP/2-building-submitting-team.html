                    Work with your partner to develop your program. Be sure to use both:

                <li>
					Create a video (two options below) of your program running. It should be <em>less than 1 minute</em> and include a description of the program either as text or a voice recording. Send the video to your teacher.
                    <ul>
                    	<li>You can create your video by using a screen-recording program like QuickTime Player (on a Mac) or by downloading a program that your teacher recommends (on a PC).</li>
                        <li>Or you can use a phone, tablet, or video camera to record your program in action.</li>

                </li>
                <li>
					Write out your reflections on the pair programming project. As a team, do each of the following:
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Describe the purpose of your program and state that you used Snap<em>!</em> to write it. (100 words or less)</li>
                        <li>Describe how your project uses <em>abstraction</em>: (100 words or less)

                            	<li>Include an image of the most complicated algorithm in your program.</li>
