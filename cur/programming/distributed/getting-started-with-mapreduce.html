            To get started, load up our finished Snap! project, <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/Snap/MapReduceStarter.xml"><code><strong>MapReduce</strong></code></a>. Your screen should look like this:

        </p>

            Now, click the green flag to get started and initialize the system. After that, you can type any number 1-5 to run one of the five MapReduces below, and '<code>r</code>' to reset to the initial state. We have given you the answers to 1, so you can see and understand what the problem is asking you to do and what the expected output is. You will construct the mapper and reducer blocks for 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the later exercises of the lab.
