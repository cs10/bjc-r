<!--ORIGINAL NAME: Your fourth MapReduce : WordCount, a count of the number of times words appears-->
</head><body>
<p> This one is a quite a bit harder because of all the list
manipulation. The idea is that you have a huge corpus of data and you
want to count all the times specific words appear. Fill in the body for
the <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/mapper-block-snap.png" alt="mapper" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/mapper.gif">
and <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/reducer-block-snap.png" alt="reducer" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/reducer.gif">
for the <code> WordCount</code> sprite and test it.</p>

<p>Remember the Midterm handout "Writing Snap! code on Paper"? Well, we
are going to add something to it. When you want to write a list of
things, write them with an open parenthesis, then the first item,
second item, etc. (separated by spaces) and when you are done, put a
closed parenthesis. If any of your items are a sentence, you have to
put quotes around the sentence. So, for example, the list of three
things:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/rights-list-snap.png" alt="rights" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/rights.png"></p>

<p>...would be written as the equivalent 3-element-list: <code>(life
liberty "pursuit of happiness")</code>. Similarly, a nested list just
shows up as a nested set of parenthesis. e.g.,</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/bjc-r/img/list/list-within-list-snap.png" alt="LoveHateThe" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/LoveHateThe.png"></p>

<p>...would be written as <code>((Love 5)(Hate 4)(The 10))</code>.
We mention this because we have used this short-cut below. Now, on to the
problem.</p>

    <tr>
      <td align="center">For every word in Shakespeare's works, the
number of times it occurs. e.g., <code>((Love 123) (Hate 4) (the
25231) etc)</code></td>
      <td align="center">All of Shakespeare's works, each word a
different list element</td>
      <td align="center">word</td>
      <td align="center">A list of a list of two elements, the word and
1. This is the same as the format of the final mapreduce output if
shakespeare would have only written one word. e.g., <code>((Love 1))</code></td>
      <td align="center">Make a list of a list of the input word and
the number 1</td>
      <td align="center">Take two lists of words and their counts and
merge them. E.g., <code>((Hate 4) (Love 3))</code> and <code>((Love
2) (The 10))</code> merge to <code>((Love 5) (Hate 4) (The 10))</code></td>
      <td align="center">a single list of lists, with each inner list a
unique word and its count</td>
    </tr>

<p>Here are some tips on how to get started with <em>WordCount</em>:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Start with the <code>mapper</code> as always.</li>
  <li>We have provided the <code>MakeWordCount</code>, <code>GetCount-from-WordCount</code>,
and <code>GetWord-from-WordCount</code> helpers. Use them as needed.</li>
  <li>When writing your <code>reducer</code>, think about the general
case of combining two lists as in the example above. <em>Hate</em> is
only in the first list. <em>The</em> is only in the second list. <em>Love</em>
is in both lists. How do you merge these two lists?</li>
  <li>We found it useful to write the helper <code>GetCount-of-Word-()-from-List</code>
... feel free to use this when writing <code>reducer</code>, but make
sure you could write this on your own too.</li>
</ol>
