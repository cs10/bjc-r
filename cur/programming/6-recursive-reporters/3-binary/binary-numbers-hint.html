        <h2>Binary numbers: Hint</h2>
        <p>Okay, here's the hint:  Positional notation works from right to left.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        	<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
            <ol>
                <li>Quick: What's the <em>rightmost </em>digit in the binary representation of 15551212? What's the rightmost bit (&quot;<strong>b</strong>inary dig<strong>it</strong>&quot;) of 123456789?  How did you know?  How can Snap<em>!</em> know the rightmost bit of a number represented in binary?</li>
                <li>What numbers can be represented in a single bit?  How will you tell Snap<em>!</em> about this?  (It's the base case.)</li>
                <li>
                    Okay, now write the block script:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursive-reporters/hint.png" alt="hint: if report else report" /><br />
                    Don't turn the page until you have this working. Don't forget
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursive-reporters/quotient.png" alt="quotient" />
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursive-reporters/mod.png" alt="mod" />
                    but dividing by 2 instead of by 5.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </body>
