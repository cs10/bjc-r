		<h2>Using multiple <code>If</code> statements</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
			<ul>
				PG: It's  difficult to interpret what's being said if the only reference is "problem 3" and the problems are later edited or changed. Please use screen shots or some other specific identifier. Because there were so many comments, and they seemed obsolete (?), I've commented them out to see the page. See html for the history.
				<!-- <li>JK: The text between the FYTD boxes is confusing. I initially read it to mean that we didn't need the "else" statement, which you do. It would make more sense if students ALSO saw the script built with the additional if and then saw that it does the same thing as the script with if/else.</li>
				<li>AC: Is there any reason not to make these reporters rather than commands?</li>
				<li>JK: I predict that no one will predict before #3. And I don't think they really need to. I think it's more fun to actually just run them, see what they do, then think about it. I think we should only ask them to predict when we really want them to predict.</li>
				<li>JK: In the Teacher notes for this lab, I would suggest that teachers display their grid and show #5 and #6 if students don't get absolute value. And I would also suggest that they not TEACH absolute value (as they might in algebra) because it's really more about distance not the boring algebra stuff. Actually, I might revise the sidenote and NOT talk about abs(-10) being 10 so much as showing a picture. Maybe say "-10 and 10 are both a distance of 10 from 0 so <code>abs of -10</code> and <code>abs of 10</code> are both 10" with a number line picture?</li>
				<li>JK: Mystery3 requires some support, I think. Teachers definitely needed it during the NYC PD week. I might suggest keeping only 3, 4, and 6 on this page, and then actually moving #5 to the next page and sitting a little longer with it. Teachers had a hard time because they didn't know what mod meant. And even after they knew the block was saying "if divisible by 4", they didn't see WHAT was being divided by 4 (the counter). And they didn't know why the counter was going from 1 to 43. What helped them was to suggest they set the counter to 4, then 8, then ask things like "if it goes to 10, what would you expect?" Or, they could play with the mod - what would you expect if it were changed to mod 20? Maybe a problem could show this script except with i going from 1 to 4, then 1 to 11, then showing the result of going 1-43 and asking them to make it? And then maybe show a result with a different mod and ask them to produce that one too. <strong>PG: problem commented out below, but not yet moved to a new location. Problems renumbered to make sense.</strong></li>
				<li>JK: Actually, I would make Mystery3 into a dialogue between Alphie and Betty. And they can say something like "this would be useful if you want something to happen every 3rd time" so that people see a more general use for mod.</li> 
				<li>Why does <span class="snap">snap</span> use "say" instead of "report"? <strong>PG: Many problems here. (1) People expect "say" to make a sound, not just print. This will almost certainly come up in classes and has already come up in PD workshops. (2) (2) Jane's point is about how to help people understand the difference in meaning between what, on the surface, appears just to be a matter of <em>where</em> the print appears. I'm tempted to rename the primitives <code>speech balloon</code> and <code>thought balloon</code>, which completely deals with the sound-v-print problem and probably mostly deals with the question Jane called attention to. Explain this in a teacher note with something like: <code>say</code> tells <em>us</em> information by making the sprite display that information on the stage, but it does not report a value that another procedure can use. <code>report</code> reports a value and, depending on what is done with the value, may or may not show that value to <em>us</em>.</strong></li> -->
