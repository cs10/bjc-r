            <ul>
                <li>We could introduce a few logic puzzles with if-then (maybe it could be in the TG as a lesson opener). Or a choose your own adventure style activity.</li>
                <li>MF: Maybe students could write their own choose their own activity at the end of the lesson.</li>
                <li>MF: Maybe we could keep the truth tables but put them in the lesson openers in the TG.</li>
                <li>(this is Dan Garcia) Take it further 4 has the interesting feature that you can change the repeat blocks to have values that don't add to 360, but say add to 90, you get a beautiful tiger pattern. Like this http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=dan%20garcia&ProjectName=Tiger and if they don't add to a number that 360 is a multiple of, the tiger pattern "moves". So there's potential for a nice conversation (which we went into in NYC) how to get the tiger pattern with the if/else that the repeat was able to give. Great followups questions 4a and 4b.</li>
