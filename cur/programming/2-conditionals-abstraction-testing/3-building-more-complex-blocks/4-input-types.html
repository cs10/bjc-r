		<h2>Input Types</h2>
        <div class="todo">
        	<ul>
            	<li>from GH: Does the max block come with import tools or did we build this earlier? Input Types: The max block has an unexpected behavior. It is intended to work only for numbers, yet you can type text into it! Max can also take text</li>
                <li><strong>More from GH:</strong> The images for #2 are too small and difficult to see?<br />You can also specify a default value for the variable if you like. This is how the move block was defined always to start as move 10 steps with the default value 10, and not just move steps with no default value specified.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        	<ol>
            	<li>In Lab 2, you created a block <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/max-of-a-and-b.gif"  alt="animation of max of A and B, showing results"> <code> max of (x) and (y)</code> that reports which of its two inputs is the greater number (the maximum). Load that block now or quickly recreate it.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>The <code>max</code> block has an unexpected behavior. It is intended to work only for numbers, yet you can type text into it! <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/max-of-cat-dog-output.png"  alt="Max of cat and dog outputs dog"></p>
    <p>You have already used <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/is-5-a-number.png" alt="is input a number"> to <em>check</em> for situations like this. You can also define blocks to <em>show</em> what the expected input type is (number, text, etc.). </p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" >
       
        <ol start="2">
         <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/edit-input-variable-x-BYOB.jpg" alt="Editing input 'x'">
      <li> Edit the <code>max</code> block. In the editor, click on the input name <code>x</code>. 
</li>
                <li>
               	  <div class="sidenote">You can also specify  a <em>default</em> value for the variable if you like. This is how the <code>move</code> block was defined always  to start as <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move-10-steps.png"  alt="move 10 steps"> with the default value 10, and not just <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move-steps.png" alt="move steps"> with no default value specified.</div> 
                Then, click  the right-arrow in the pop-up box. The dialog  lets you choose the input type you want. Click the Number slot. The <em>shape</em> of the slot tells people  what type of input the block expects.

                </li>
                <li>Change both  <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>  to take only numbers and to have the default values of 5 and 10. You will see this in the Block Editor. 
                  <div class="sidenote">The variable <em>names</em> are still <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, even though the block's title line  looks different. The #  indicates that the input should be a number; the &quot;= 5&quot; shows the default value.</div>
                     
        <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Block-editor-max-block.png" width="420"  alt="'max' block with defaults"></p>
                    <p>When you click OK, your block should look like this <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/max of 5 and 10.png" alt="max of 5 and 10">. You can no longer type text as input.</p>
                </li>
                	<div class="takeNote">
          <p>When an input type is restricted, a block can still receive improper values. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/max of true and 10.png" alt="max of true and 10"> <span class="snap">snap</span> doesn’t constantly check to see what types are passed as values. Specifying the input type is  an organizational tool to remind <em>you</em> what the domain (input values) of your blocks should be.</p>
          <p>If you have a job writing computer programs that do something people rely on, a lot of the effort goes into making sure all your inputs are of the correct type. This can get complicated; maybe the input has to be a <em>positive</em> number; maybe it has to be a positive number that's a multiple of 1/100 (i.e., an amount expressed in dollars, but a whole number of cents). It's not unusual for the error-checking code to be longer than the part of the program that actually does the work. But in this course it's generally okay to ignore possible input errors, as long as your programs work correctly for <em>correct</em> inputs. We want to keep you focused on the interesting parts of the projects.</p>
