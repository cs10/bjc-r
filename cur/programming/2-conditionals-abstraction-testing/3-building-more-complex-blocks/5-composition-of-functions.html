                Debugging can be a pain. Here are some tips for writing code without (or with fewer) bugs:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Start Small</strong>: Build one (small) part of your program and get it working right before moving on to the next piece.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep it Working</strong>: When you build the next piece, get that new piece working before you move on again.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>This approach is nice because you won't have a huge mess with many bugs to sort out and you'll have something that works to share with your teacher and other programmers at every step of the way.</p>

        <p>Here is one way to define <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/max-3-arg.png" alt="max of () and () and ()" title="max of () and () and ()" />:</p>
