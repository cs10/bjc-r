		<h2>Reporter Blocks</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <ul>
                <li>MF: I found this page and the next confusing enough that actually I went back to the <span class="snap">snap</span> manual to double-check what reporters are. :/</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>You have defined  &quot;command&quot; blocks, blocks that carry out an action like drawing on the stage or having the sprite say something. You have also defined &quot;reporter&quot; blocks, blocks that  perform a calculation (like the plural of a word) and report the result. Many blocks on the "operators" palette are reporters.</p>

    	    Commands have the click-together groove and bump at the top and  bottom. Reporters are often used <em>inside</em> other blocks, like <code>say</code> or <code>set</code> or <code>move</code> or <code>join</code>. For example:

		<div class="forYouToDo">
        	<ol>
        		<li> Create a block that takes a number as input and outputs that number squared. Here is one way to do that: <br /> <img src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/square-of-x.png" alt="square(x) block definition"/></li>
    			<li>Now create blocks for these functions:
  					<ol> 
                    	<li> <code>cube x</code> that takes a number <em>x</em> as input and outputs <em>x</em><sup>3</sup> </li>
						<li> <code> reciprocal x </code> that takes a number <em>x</em> as input and outputs 1/<em>x</em> </li>
						<li> <code>phi</code> that takes no input but outputs the value ((square root of 5) + 1) / 2</li>
    					<li> 
                        	<div class="sidenote"><code> abs</code> is a built-in reporter, but write your own.</div> 
                        	<code>abs x</code> that takes a number as input and if that number is zero or positive, reports the number, but if the number is less than zero, multiplies it by -1 and reports the result. 
                        </li>
    				</ol>
                </li>
    			<li>Create a block that converts degrees Farenheit to degrees Celsius. (You can find the conversion formula on Wikipedia and elsewhere.)</li>
    			<li>
                	Predict what this block will report when it is run with inputs "hello" and 5. <br />
