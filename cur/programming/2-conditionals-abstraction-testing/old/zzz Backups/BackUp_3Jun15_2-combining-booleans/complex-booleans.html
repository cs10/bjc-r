        	<li>JK: WHAT IS GOING ON WITH UNIT 2???!?!! Why is this page here? It feels like maybe ALL of Lab 3 comes before this??? Why is it called "MORE" complex booleans? I'm so confused!!!!!</li>

          <li> Then edit the <code>What's my rule?</code> block and change it to say "yup" only to numbers between 10 and 20.</li>
          <li> Use <img class="block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/or.png" alt="or"/> instead of <img class="block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/and.png" alt="and"/> to make a block that says "yup" only to numbers that are less than 10 or greater than 20.</li>

Try it out  to see how it works. Then modify it to get some more interesting behavior and share your idea with others. </li>
