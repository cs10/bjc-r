		<title>Unit 2 Lab 5: Bits and Information</title>
	</head>

	<body>
    	<h2>Getting Started (In process)</h2>
        
        <div>Content to come. Will be based on Blown to Bits chapter 3. See earlier Social Implications Labs for examples of what this page will look like.</div>

		<div class="todo">JK: It occurs to me that one thing we lose in not reading the Koans piece is the part about Moore's Law (Number of transistors that can fit inot a specific area will double every 18-24 months). I still don't think reading the Koans part is worth it, but Moore's Law is probably useful to have that be a part of what gets presented to students. It's referred to in chapter 3. Maybe it can just be a sidenote in this unit?</div>
        
        <p>Notes about BtB Chapter 3</p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>What You See Is Not What the Computer Knows (p 73-80) - Includes section on metadata.</li>
                <li>Representations, Reality, and Illusion (p 80-94) - How digital photography works, bits, [note: have students play with a rasterizer], image quality, preserving and losing information, lossless and lossy compression, open source software (maybe skip the part about open source software)</li>
                <li>Hiding Information in Images (p 95-99) - First part is about spam (maybe skip because outdated? It's about spam in the form of images), but second part (97-99) is about steganography, which is interesting!</li>
                <li>The Scary Secrets of Old Disks (p 99-108) - First part is about erasing data from disks, disk organization itself, and then a philosophical bit about data and whether turning everything digital actually reduces its lifespan as technologies become obsolete.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Structure for this lab:</p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Getting started - unplugged activity about compression? It's a little too simplistic. Code.org one is better.. - playing with a rasterizer?</li>
                <li>Reading Representations, Reality, and Illusion</li>
                <li>[Perhaps an unplugged activity about compression?]</li>
                <li>Steganography</li>
                <li>[What is the social implications part of this lab? It's about our own beliefs about data - about how long it will last and about how well-protected it is and our ability to control it (delete it and know what does and doesn't exist). So how to bring this to students? Maybe through the idea of control of information? Or "processing is power" idea - so something about the kinds of innovations that are needed and some of the solutions to issues? - Maybe think about the limitations of data and representations currently. What innovations are necessry for progress?]</li>
                <li>Knowing the dangers? What can be hidden in data... Understanding more of the bit/byte structure</li>
                <li>Do a more extensive writing assignment aligned to an Explore prompt about an innovation - maybe specifically about how it deals with data - and the innovation should be something related to what's in the chapter.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>Maybe something about digital citizenship? Here are some online resources. I was actually thinking that, if possible, it would be great if the students could connect with a younger middle school class and teach one of these lessons. It's a different way of engaging with the materials, and the high schoolers can think if this is an effective way to get the message across to middle schoolers.

        <div>This might be an <a href="http://blossoms.mit.edu/videos/files/english_subtitled/magic_picture_steganography_bitmap_files_english_closed_caption_flash" target="_blank">extra resource</a> for teachers IF they want it? It feels like it might be a little hard to use (not just because of subtitles, but because the actual hiding is done via software, and I'm not sure it's easy to <em>get</em>. Oh maybe we can use this program: http://www.salaamsoft.com/bmp/ though I can't get it to work.</div>
