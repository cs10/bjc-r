	  	<p>
	  		There are two essential kinds of loop in (also in most of other text programming languages as well) Python, they are For-Loop and While-Loop.
	  	</p>

	  		<table>
	  			<tr>
	  				<td><img src="../../../../img/python/for1to10.png" alt="for-loop"/></td>
	  				<td>
	  					<pre><code><blockquote>
		for i in range(x, y):
			do something
	  					</blockquote></code></pre>
	  			</tr>
	  		</table>
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		<code># this for-loop will "do something" y times, unless specified.</code><br><br>
	  		<b>Note:</b> <br><br> The range function can also be written with one argument like this: <code>range(y):</code><br> This just means that you're not explicitly telling it to start from a specific number but rather from 0 to y - 1.<br>
	  		Also, there are many ways that we can utilize a for-loop. Let's consider a list, just like in <span class="snap">snap</span>. Let's call this list <code>lst</code>.<br> Then we can also do this with a for-loop: <code>for i in lst:</code><br><br>
	  		There are other cool things we can do with a for-loop, you will learn these tools as you become more familiar with Python.

			<code># this while-loop will "do something" as long as "condition" remains true.</code><br><br>

			Let's take a look at some examples:<br>
			<pre><code><blockquote>
def add_one_n_times(n):
	if (n < 0):
		return n
	else:
		result = 0
		for i in range(n):
			result += 1
		return result
			</blockquote></code></pre>
			<code>
			# If you notice the "report block in <span class="snap">snap</span>, we can't attach anything <br>
			# after that block. That is because it will terminate the function <br>
			# immediately after that statement is executed. The concept is the same <br>
			# in Python, after the "return" statement is executed, the whole function <br>
			# terminates. 		
			</code>
			<blockquote><code>
			>>> add_one_n_times(-5)<br>
			-5 <br>
			>>> add_one_n_time(5)<br>
			5 <br>
			</code></blockquote>
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's write another function <code>min(x, y, z)</code> using only a while loop. Note that this function will only work for <b>all positive values</b>.

			<pre><blockquote><code>
def min(x, y, z):
	m = 0
	while (x != 0 and y != 0 and z != 0):
		x -= 1
		y -= 1
		z -= 1
		m += 1
	return m
			</code></blockquote></pre>

			Quick Quiz: (discuss with your partner, verify with TA for answer)<br>
			1. How can we write <code>add_one_n_times(n)</code> using a while loop instead of a for loop. <br>
			2. What is the difference between a while loop in Python and a repeat until in <span class="snap">snap</span>?<br>
