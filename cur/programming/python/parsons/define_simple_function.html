        Defining a function in Python is easy! In your text editor, a function <code>count-up</code> in Python may look like this (to the right is the exact same function written in snap):
        <table style="width:auto; table-height:200px">
                  <tr>
                      <td>
                          <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/simple_python_function_colored.png"/>
                      </td>
                      <td>
                          <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/count_up_function.png"/>
                    </td>
                  </tr>
              </table>
              <p>
                  <b>Function Header:</b> Like in Snap<em>!</em>, the function header specifies the name of the function, and any arguments (a.k.a. input variables, parameters) of the function. Notice the line must begin with the keyword <code>def</code> and end with a <code>:</code>. This lets the Python interpreter know that the indented lines that follow are part of a function definition.
              </p>
              <p class="alert alert-warning quoteOrange">In Snap<em>!</em> it's common to have text between function parameters, such as the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mod.png" alt="Snap! mod block" />. In Python, all parameters must come at the end of a function, between parentheses<code>()</code>.
              </p>

              <p> In order to call a function, type the function name, followed by the inputs in parentheses. For example, if you wanted to run <code>count_up</code> above with <code>num = 4</code>, you would type <code>count_up(4)</code>.</p>
              <br>

              <h3>For Loop</h3>

              <p>
                  The <code>for</code> loop in Python works similarly to our Snap<em>!</em> <code>for</code> loop with some key differences. To have the index variable <code>i</code> increment from <code>1 to num</code>, we have to create an <b>iterable</b>. For now, think of an iterable as anything that can act like a list of items. Starting with the first item, <code>i</code> takes each consecutive item of the list as its value. The <code>range(x, y)</code> function receives two numbers and returns an iterable of all numbers beginning with <code>x</code> and ending with <code>y-1</code>.
              </p>
              <p>In your file <code>lab1.py</code>, copy and paste the following code. </p>
              <p><pre><code>
def count_up(num):
    for i in range(1, num+1):
        print(i)
              </code></pre></p>
              <p>Then, in the terminal run your Python file using the command <code>python -i lab1.py</code>. This will run the code in your file and leave the interpreter open for you, in case you want to run more code.</p>
              <p> Now that you have your terminal open, you can call <code>count_up</code>. Call <code>count_up(4)</code> and see what it prints! Is this what you expected?</p>
              <pre><code>
>>> count_up(4)
1
2
3
4
            </code></pre>
            <p class="alert alert-warning quoteOrange">
                Make sure you notice: The iterable returned by range(x,y) does NOT include y. For this reason, if we want the count-up to include the input <code>num</code>, the <code>count_up</code> function must use a range that goes from <code>1</code> to <code>num + 1</code>.
