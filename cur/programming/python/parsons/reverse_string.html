    	<h3>Exercise 4: Reverse String</h3>
        <p class="alert alert-success quoteGreen">
            Write the function <code>reverse_string(string)</code> that takes in a string and puts it in the reverse order as shown below:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
>>> reverse_string("Alonzo")
'oznolA'

        </code></pre></p>
        <p> For this problem, instead of dragging and dropping code in the browser, you will write code free form using a text editor. To do so, open up your <code>lab1.py</code> file that you created, and define a new function. If you need help, refer to <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/python/run_a_python_script.html" target="_blank" >this page</a> or ask a staff member for help!</p>

        <p class="alert alert-info quoteBlue">
            You'll want to use some sort of loop, along with some of the things that you've learned about strings in this section.  You may not use the <code>[::-1]</code> syntax. When you think your function works, you can run the tests we've provided in our autograder. To run the autograder, first download <a style = "color: #a71111" target = "_blank" href="/bjc-r/prog/python/parsons/autograder.py">this file</a> (right click and hit "Save As") <i>and place it into the same directory (folder) as <code>lab1.py</code></i>. Then, in your Terminal window, you can run the following command to check for correctness:
        </p>
        <p>If you're stuck, you can also try to debug your code using print statement! See the first section at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lyCKKtJ_tf7kji8H9bKSQn4U3pA1Uw0QRchinWHQ--k/edit?usp=sharing">this link</a> for more information on how you can print to debug.</p>
