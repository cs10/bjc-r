        <p>
          One of the most interesting and important things we can do as a programmer is to manipulate and analyze real world data. Python is a particularly great language for data processing, because of the very powerful open source data manipulation libraries available <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/NumericAndScientific">online</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
          Installing such libraries is beyond the scope of this course (see CS61A and/or C8 instead), so we'll be working mostly with libraries that are built into Python. In this lab, we'll work with text data. 
          </p>

          <p>
          This lab will also give you a chance to develop a full python program totally from scratch (with no starter code). 
          </p>

          <p>
          To get started on this lab:
          <ul>
          <li>Create a new folder called "datalab" on your computer (the name doesn't actually matter, but I'll assume that's the name you used). 
          </li>
          <li>Download the data for this lab from <a href="/bjc-r/prog/python/text_processing.zip">this link</a>. 
          </li>
          <li>Unzip this file into the datalab folder. You can unzip this file through the command line by using the  <code>unzip</code> command.
            <pre><code>$$ unzip text_processing.zip
$$ ls
text_processing.zip  text_processing
$$ cd text_processing
$$ ls
