    	<p>
    		In this lab we will explore using functions as data in python. Python makes it really easy to pass functions in as inputs. In your previous assignments, you've been exposed to HOF blocks like map, keep, and combine. You likely used them to carry out relatively simple tasks, like summing a list with combine, or filtering based on word length with keep. In this lab, you're going to attack some more complicated problems in python with the help of HOFs. In addition, you're going to see how functions can be treated as data, and how you can define your own blocks that take in functions as input, just like map, keep, and combine in Snap<em>!</em> do.

    	<h3>Starter File</h3>
        <p>
            Refer to the previous lab for instructions on how to open and use a shell application (terminal for Mac/Linux users and the CMD command prompt for Windows users).  Once you have a shell up and running, <code>cd</code> into your documents directory and use <code>mkdir PythonLab3</code> to create a new directory called PythonLab3. Use <code>cd PythonLab3</code> to enter the directory. Save this <a href="/bjc-r/prog/python/python-lab3/lab3.py">file</a> as <code>lab3.py</code> to the PythonLab3 directory. <code>lab3.py</code> contains the function signatures to get you started. Save this <a href="/bjc-r/prog/python/python-lab3/autograder.py">file</a> as <code>autograder.py</code> to the PythonLab3 directory as well. Next you will be doing some exercises where you will use HOFs and list comprehension.
