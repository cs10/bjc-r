      		<span class="snap">snap</span>, sprites can "say" things, but as you know, only a single phrase (or string) can be displayed within a speech bubble at once (which is temporary). In Python, you can “print” something to the console (which is permanent), which is where text output is displayed. <span class="snap">snap</span> was designed for animation, which is why there is an available stage and “saying” is represented as a cartoony speech bubble. Python can be used for manipulating data, so being able to print out many things, and seeing them at the same time, is a useful feature.

	  		Type the following into the Python interpreter and see what happens. Also, make sure to indent! (We will be covering loop syntax later, so do not worry if this this code does not make sense)<br>
	  		<pre><code><blockquote>
for item in range(1, 10):
	print(item)
			</blockquote></code></pre>
			In Snap!, this is very similar to:
			<blockquote><img src="../../../../img/python/foritemsayitem.png" alt="for loop say"/></blockquote>
			What happened? You should have seen an output like this:<br>
			<pre><code>
	1
	2
	3
	4
	5
	6
	7
	8
	9
			</code></pre>
			<b>NOTE:</b> In Python, a range is represented by the interval notation [x, y) so x is inclusive in the range, but y is exclusive (stops before the y value). In <span class="snap">snap</span>, the end value is included.
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		Just like "saying" in <span class="snap">snap</span>, printing in Python is a side effect. To print in Python, all you need to do is type:
	  		<code><blockquote>print(*)</blockquote></code>
	  		* is a placeholder for whatever you wish to print. If it is a number, you can just type a number. But if you want to type text, then you must surround it with quotations (either double or single quotes). We'll learn more about printing variables and such a little later.<br><br>
	  		Now, trying printing your name, or print anything you'd like.
