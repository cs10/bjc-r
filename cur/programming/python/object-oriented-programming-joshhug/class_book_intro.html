          Say we want to write code to represent books. One way to go about this is to have an overarching class called "Book", each instance of which is one particular book. 

          For now, we'll start with a blank Book class, which has no attributes and no functionality. In line with common Python convention, we will give our class a name that starts with a capital letter, in this case "Book".

          At this starting point, our Python code would look as follows:
           <pre><code>
class Book:
    pass
           </code></pre>
         </p>
          <p>
            <h3>Creating a book and adding attributes:</h3>
            The code below creates a Book, then adds a genre, a title, an author, and a publication year to that book object.

           <pre><code>
hunger_games = Book()
hunger_games.genre = "Dystopian fiction"
hunger_games.title = "The Hunger Games"
hunger_games.author = "Suzanne Collins"
hunger_games.publication_year = 2008
           </code></pre>          

          </p>

          <p>After adding these attributes, we can then access them using dot notation:

            <pre><code>
print(hunger_games.publication_year)
2008
print(hunger_games.author)
English
            </code></pre>            
          </p>
