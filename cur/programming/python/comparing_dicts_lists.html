        <h3>Abstract differences between Lists and Dictionaries</h3>
        <p>
            Dictionaries are similar to lists, except instead of using a numerical index to insert and retrieve an "item", you use a <b>key and value</b>. For example, if you think of a dictionary as a phone book, the <b>key</b> would be a person's name, and the <b>value</b> would be their phone number. How do you find someone's phone number? You use their name to look it up!
        </p>
        <p>     
            <b>Every key in a dictionary must be unique</b> so that we know which value to return for a given key. But dictionaries are NOT sorted. What makes dictionaries useful is that we assign a key to each value, instead of a numerical index like we do for a list. Here are visual examples of a list and a dictionary to help you understand the differnece:
