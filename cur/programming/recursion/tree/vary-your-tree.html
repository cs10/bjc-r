		Change your tree in the following ways. You should probably try these one at a time so that you can always tell which change you made caused a new bug.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				change the turn angle
			</li>
			<li>
				change the scale factor
			</li>
			<li>
				change the number of recursive calls
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Note: If your character goes off the screen your image might get messed up, because your sprite will fail to change its y-position outward and then will come back too far inward.
