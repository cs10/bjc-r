<h2>Recursive Tree, Part 3</h2>
<p>Last time, we tried to generalize this pattern:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../img/5-recursion/tree2.png" alt="tree2">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../../../../img/5-recursion/tree3.png" alt="tree3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../../../../img/5-recursion/tree4.png" alt="tree4"></p>
<p>by making a single block that took the level number as an <em>input, </em>instead of as part of the block name:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../img/5-recursion/tree-nobase.png" alt="tree script first version"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it did not work:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../img/5-recursion/treebug.gif" alt="picture of failing tree"></p>
<p>The sprite draws smaller and smaller left branches, finally just
spinning around in one place, without ever drawing a right branch.</p>
<p>What went wrong? The problem is that the original numbered <code>tree</code> scripts <em>aren't </em>all the same. The first one, <code>tree1</code>, is different; it just draws a trunk, without any branches:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../img/5-recursion/tree1.png" alt="tree1 script" /></p>
<p>So our all-in-one <code>tree</code> block has to do something different from what's now in the script for the case <code>levels=1</code>.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../img/5-recursion/tree.png" alt="correct tree script" /></p>
<p>With this change, we can draw trees of any complexity. Here's a level-9 tree:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../img/5-recursion/tree9.png" alt="picture of tree on stage" /></p>
<div class="forYouToDo" style="background-color:#f7c000">(Note: the amount of time required to draw the tree goes up very quickly with the number of levels, so we don't recommend trying 100 levels.)</div>
<p><strong>This general code pattern, with a simple <em>base case </em>that doesn't call the block itself, is typical of recursion. (<em>Recursion </em>is the name for a block that calls itself in its script.) There's a base case and a recursive case.</strong></p>
