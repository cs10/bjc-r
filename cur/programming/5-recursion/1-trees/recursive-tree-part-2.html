           <li><p>That <code>tree2a</code> block is pretty long and repetitive. But we can simplify it if we notice that in two places it has a move forward/move back pair of blocks, and that this is what <code>tree1</code> does! So we can use <code>tree1</code> to shorten <code>tree2</code>. Compare the code below to convince yourself that the new <code>tree2</code> will work the same as the original <code>tree2a</code>.

		Note that the tree blocks inside this <code>tree2</code> script are <code>tree1</code> blocks, not <code>tree2</code> blocks! So there's no mysterious <code>tree</code>-using-<code>tree</code> situation here; it's not unusual for one already-written block to be used in <em>another</em>&thinsp; block's script. </li>
<li>Why are we multiplying <code>size</code> by 0.75?</li>
<li>What would happen if we used a negative <code>size</code>?</li>
<li>Why is the right turn amount 30 degrees instead of 15?</li>
           <li>Make a <code>tree3</code> block that uses the <code>tree2</code> block, on the same pattern, and see if you get the result that you expect. </li>
	<li>Make a <code>tree4</code> block that uses the <code>tree3</code> block and try it out. </li>
    <li>If you can stand it, make a <code>tree5</code> block that uses the <code>tree4</code> block and try it out. </li></ol></div></div>

These blocks all look exactly the same, don't they? So it makes sense to wonder if we can replace them all with a single <code>tree</code> block. Here's the big idea: We can write a <code>tree</code> block that uses itself in its own script <i>provided that it knows how many levels it's expected to draw!</i>&thinsp; So, in addition to the <code>size</code> input, it'll have a <code>levels</code> input:</p>
         <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-recursion/tree-header.png" width="311" height="64" alt="tree (_) levels, size (_)">
		<p>
		In the earlier steps, <code>tree3</code> used <code>tree2</code>; <code>tree2</code> used <code>tree1</code>. If you actually had the patience to work up to a <code>tree437</code> block, what block would it call for its two branches? To generalize the pattern, <code>tree</code> will use <code>tree</code>, but reducing the number of levels by 1:</p>
		<p><img src="../../../../img/5-recursion/tree-nobase.png" alt="recursive tree, first version"></p>
		<p>For example, given a <code>levels</code> input of 5, <code>tree</code> will call two trees with a <code>levels</code> input of 4. Those two trees in turn will each call two more trees with a <code>levels</code> input of 3, and so on.</p>
		<p>Now try the <code>tree</code> block. What happens? <em>Why </em>does it happen? When you know the answer, go to the next activity.
