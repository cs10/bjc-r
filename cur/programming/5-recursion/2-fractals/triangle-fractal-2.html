		<h2>Triangle Fractal #2</h2>
		<p>TAKE IT FURTHER</p>
		<p>Okay, no hints this time. Level 1 is an equilateral triangle. Here are levels 2 and 3:</p>
		<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/5-recursion/tri-frac-2-level-2.png" width="332" height="278" alt="fractal level 2"><img src="/bjc-r/img/5-recursion/tri-frac-2-level-3.png" width="332" height="278" alt="fractal level 3"></p>
		<p>And here's level 8:</p>
		<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/5-recursion/tri-frac-2-level-8.png" width="332" height="278" alt="fractal level 8"></p>
		<p>If you compare the level 2 picture with the one from the previous page, you'll see that the basic idea is the same: Stick little triangles at the corners of big ones. But they're stuck together slightly differently.</p>
		<p>TAKE IT EVEN FURTHER</p>
		<p>This time, instead of balancing the smaller triangles symmetrically on the corners of the bigger triangle, turn 30 degrees left after drawing each side and before the recursive call, and use size/√3 as the size in the recursive call. Then make a level-10 fractal inside a <code>warp</code> block.  (Find it in the Control palette.)</p>
