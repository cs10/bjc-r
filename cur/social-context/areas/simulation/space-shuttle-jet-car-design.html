We can accurately model wind resistance, temperature change, pressure variation and a multitude of other factors as formulas and calculate them all in a matter of minutes instead of days or weeks. In addition, we're able to try entirely new designs virtually before working with a single piece of real-world material to determine whether a project is worth pursuing or if the design needs to be changed. <br><br>Why is this so great?
<ol><li>It's possible to do a lot of the planning and testing of a design in a much shorter period of time for much less money than it was in the past.</li>
  <li>It's possible to see what points of a structure will bear the most stress, and therefore which parts should be reinforced.</li>
  <li>Adjusting a model is far simpler than rebuilding a real-world prototype.</li>

Software is now available for simulating conditions on buildings, bridges, cars, space shuttles and satellites, and beyond.   </body></html>
