Often, we will also want to use a range of values in a list.  The first two scripts below allow the character to say the values of a range of list elements.  Before testing them, however, think about whether they also include the elements at the start and end indexes.  Then, fill in the blank in the third script with a <tt>repeat</tt> block (and not a <tt>repeat until</tt> block), such that it does the same thing as the middle block.
