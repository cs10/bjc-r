h2: Big Ideas
big-idea: Every programming language has 3rd party resources that are constantly being developed
big-idea: Libraries in Snap! and Python, along with extensions in Snap! come in all different varities
big-idea: Using these Libraries/extensions can be extremely fun and rewarding!

h2: Activities
learning-goal: Introduce yourself to a couple 3rd party Snap/Python resources
