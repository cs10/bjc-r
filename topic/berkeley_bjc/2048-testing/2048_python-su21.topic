title: Object-Oriented Programming & Intro to Project 3
{
h2: Introduction to the game 2048
big-idea: Understand the essentials of 2048 and Object-Oriented Programming: <code>test</code>.
big-idea: We've seen lists, dictionaries, etc. as types of data structures in Python, but now we will see objects as a data structure
big-idea: Each object is an instance of some Class. Python has built-in classes and objects, but we can also define our own
big-idea: The object system is designed so our object acts as an actual real-life object of that type would. For instance, if we had a Class Book, and created a specific Book object, we should be able to ask for its title, author, and genre
big-idea: Classes can be hierarchical. For example, the Book Class above might have a subclass Textbook

h2: Activities
learning-goal: Understand the 2048 assignment spec.
learning-goal: Build up a class that represents a book object step-by-step by just following along
learning-goal: Learn about the basics of OOP in Python while completing above activity
learning-goal: Use the aforementioned knowledge to build your own UC Berkeley Memes for Edgy Teens class
