                CS10 is the undergraduate Beauty and Joy of Computing course at U.C. Berkeley, and 
                will generally reflect newer content with which we are experimenting in class (on our poor students!).
                Some of these materials may be advanced, fast paced, and/or unpolished.
                More info about the CS10 course is available at <a target="_blank" href="http://cs10.berkeley.edu">cs10.berkeley.edu</a>.
