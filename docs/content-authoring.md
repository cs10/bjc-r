# Authorship

## Hierarchy:

* Course
    * Topic
        * Curriculum Page

## Writing Style
There are a few tips for keeping a consistent tone with labs.

* Avoid Berkeley or CS10 specific references.
* Write in the 2nd person.
* Keep paragraphs short, but reasonable.
* __Page length recommendations coming soon...__
* Strike a middle ground between colloquial and formal
* The writing should be accessible to high school audiences
* Snap! should always be written in code as `<span class="snap">snap</span>`
* Distinguish between programming concepts and Snap-isms.
* __Contractions... idk...__
* If you introduce a new (CS) word be sure the meaning is clear!
* More to come! :-)

Despite the state of this document, proper punctuation, spelling and grammar 
should most definitely be followed! Also, typing liek dis is prolly no good, ok?
## Features
There are a number of CSS features and things that make labs cool. We will 
update this soon to describe how to use them.

* Inline Images
* Quizzes
* Tips
* Special Headings
* Definitions


## Content Management
We have a number of oddly structured directories... follow them:

1. Name files in a descriptive manner. Long names are OK.
2. Lowercase names are better. The "HOFs" directory is poor sportsmanship.
3. TBD

Basic Directories:

(Those which are bolded are most important.)

* `course`   -- Contains 'classes'
* `cur`      -- __Contains lab content, as HTML or Markdown files__
* `glossary` -- Not Used.
* `img`      -- __Contains ALL images for all labs__
  * `img/blocks`  -- __A special directory where all *single* block images go__
* `prog`     -- __Contains all Snap/BYOB files used when making labs__
* `topic`    -- Contains 'topics' or the idea of a lab.

For `cur`, `img`, and `prog` the structure below is followed.
There is some basic breakdown of topics, but not everything is exact. If 
something fits multiple categories put it where it 'most' applies OR with the
other resources for that lab. These folders may have subfolders as well. 

__*Avoid organizing based on lab number or name!*__

* `programming`/
   * `abstraction`
   * `algorithms`
   * `build-a-block`
   * `concurrency`
   * `conditionals`
   * `data`
   * `distributed`
   * `functions`
   * `hash-tables`
   * `HOFs`
   * `internet`
   * `intro`
   * `lists`
   * `loops`
   * `projects`
   * `random`
   * `recursion`
   * `sequential-v-parallel`
   * `simulation`
   * `snap`                  -- things specific to Snap UI.
   * `sorting`
   * `strings`
   * `variables`
* `social-context`
   * `apps`
   * `areas`
   * `concerns`
   * `future`
   * `history`
   * `misc`                 -- basically if it doesn't deserve its own folder...
